                         Clusters
    This small example illustrates dot's feature to draw nodes and edges in
    clusters or separate rectangular layout regions. Clusters are encoded as
    subgraphs whose names have the prefix 'cluster'. The color attribute of a
    cluster is interpreted as its outline color or its background color if its
    style is 'filled'. Mdiamond and Msquare are modified symbols for data flow
    diagrams.

digraph G {

        subgraph cluster_0 {
                style=filled;
                color=lightgrey;
                node [style=filled,color=white];
                a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
                label = "process #1";
        }

        subgraph cluster_1 {
                node [style=filled];
                b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
                label = "process #2";                       [cluster]
                color=blue
        }
        start -> a0;
        start -> b0;
        a1 -> b3;
        b2 -> a3;
        a3 -> a0;
        a3 -> end;
        b3 -> end;

        start [shape=Mdiamond];
        end [shape=Msquare];
}
