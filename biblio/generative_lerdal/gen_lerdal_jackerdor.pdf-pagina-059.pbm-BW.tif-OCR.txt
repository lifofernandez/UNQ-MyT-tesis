Grouping Overlaps

foolish to attempt to quantify local rules of grouping without a far better
understanding of how these rules interact with other rules whose effects
are in many ways not comparable.

Both the problem of overprecision and that of global considerations
are acknowledged by Tenney and Polansky (1980), whose theory of mu-
sical grouping in many ways resembles ours (see note 3). They state
quantified rules of local detail, which are used by a computer program to
predict grouping judgments. They point out, however, that their system
does not comfortably account for vague or ambiguous grouping judg-
ments, because of its numerical character, and they note the essential
arbitrariness in the choice of numerical weights. And, although aware of
the need for global rules such as those of symmetry and parallelism, they
do not incorporate these rules into their system. It is our impression that
they do not really confront the difficulty of how in principle one balances
global against local considerations.

To sum up: Our theory cannot provide a computable procedure for
determining musical analyses. However, achieving computability in any
meaningful way requires a much better understanding of many difficult
musical and psychological issues than exists at present. In the meantime
we have attempted to make the theory as predictive as possible by stating
rules clearly and following through their consequences carefully, avoid-
ing ad hoc adjustments that make analyses work out the way we want.
We believe that the insights the theory has been able to afford are
sufficient justification for this methodology.

The term overlap has had a number of uses in the music literature. This
section is devoted to overlaps in grouping structure, an important class of
counterexamples to the grouping well-formedness rules. The discussion is
in two parts. The first discusses the perceptual phenomena of grouping
overlap and elision; the second describes some of the mechanisms needed
to incorporate overlap and elision into the formal theory.

The Perception of Grouping Overlaps and Elisions

In section 3.1 we remarked that there is a discrepancy between the pre-
dictions of GWER 4 (“If a group G¡ contains part of a group G, it must
contain all of G>”) and certain actual musical intuitions according to
which groups overlap. A typical case is the beginning of Mozart's Sonata
K. 279 (example 3.25).

In this example, the beginnings of the third and fifth measures are heard
as belonging to two intersecting groups at once, at various levels of
grouping. This situation is a violation of GWFR 4, since there are groups
that contain part but not all of other groups. Such situations are common
