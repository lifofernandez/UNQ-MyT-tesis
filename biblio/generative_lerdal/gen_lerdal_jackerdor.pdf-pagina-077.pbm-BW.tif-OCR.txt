larger metrical levels, just as the original MWER 4 prohibited them at all
levels. For instance, it says that the rhythm of example 4.7 (as in Bruck-
ner's Eighth Symphony, first movement) is possible only with a half-note
or larger tactus, not with a quarter-note tactus.

This prediction corresponds with the intuition that 4.7 is most likely
“felt” in half-note metrical units. It also is borne out by the fact that, in
the literature of tonal music, triplets in predominantly duple metrical
environments are not uncommon at small metrical levels but are rare at
large metrical levels.

Which metrical level of a piece is heard as the tactus? The fact that
there are often disputes about this indicates that a preference-rule mech-
anism is at work. Although we cannot provide a full account of how the
tactus is chosen, certain influences are fairly clear. The first is absolute
speed: the tactus is invariably between about 40 and 160 beats per min-
ute, and often close to the traditional Renaissance tactus of 70. (The
relationship of this rate to the human pulse has often been noted, though
an explanation of why there should be such a relation berween physio-
logical and psychological rates is far less obvious than one might first
think.) Second, the tactus cannot be too far away from the smallest
metrical level: a succession of notes of short duration is generally an
indication of a relatively fast tactus, unless the subdivisions are intro-
duced gradually, as often happens in slow movements or variation
movements. On the other hand, the tactus is usually not faster than the
prevailing note values. Thus the radical change in note values during the
first theme in the finale of Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (4.8) sets up a
conflict in choice of tactus: the whole notes in measures 1-4 suggest a
whole-note tactus, while the eighth and sixteenth notes in measures 6-8
(plus the eighth-note accompaniment) suggest a faster tactus. The conflict
is resolved by a compromise at the half-note level.
