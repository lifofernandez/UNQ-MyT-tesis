of the other. This is the structure that would have resulted if the 16 had
been chosen ahead of the V* in 9.14. Instead we chose 9.18b—at the
time, on linear grounds.

But there is another reason not to prefer 9.18a: it implies that the
second occurrence of the motive is part of the first, rather than a self-
contained entity. PRPR 2 (congruence to time-span segmentation), which
is especially effective at these small levels, addresses this difficulty, since
9.18b is congruent to the time-span segmentation and 9.18a is not. This
can be seen more clearly in these examples by comparing the time-span
segmentation with the “prolongational grouping” (the domains defined
by the extent of prolongational elaborations). Thus PRPR 2 has an impor-
tant effect on the delineation of motivic structure in prolongational re-
duction: it keeps motives prolongationally intact.

This derivation has illustrated the typical way in which the PRPRs
interact. The primary influences on prolongational structure are PRPRs 1
and 3, with PRPRs 2, 4, and $ helping to decide otherwise indeterminate
cases. What makes K. 331 unusual is the number of times the Interaction
Principle has to be invoked, resulting in repeated prolongational subor-
dination of the time-span-important “vi7.” Most pieces do not display
such a disparity between time-span and prolongational importance, but
to the extent that they do, itis as a result of the Interaction Principle, as in
this example.

An additional case where the Interaction Principle plays a role is in
deriving the prolongational structure of deceptive cadences, illustrated in
9.7. In a deceptive cadence, it is typically the case that the V forms a more
stable prolongational connection with its surroundings than does the vi.
Because the V is immediately subordinate to the vi in the time-span
reduction, the Interaction Principle says that it should be chosen as e; in
the relevant region, with the vi subordinate, as shown in 92.7. Hence
deceptive cadences, unlike full cadences, display a reversal of pro-
longational importance, with the dominant more important than the
resolution.

To sum up: the Interaction Principle states how the time-span reduc-
tion regulates prolongational importance. In constructing a prolon-
gational reduction, we can, for each prolongational region, simply search
for the strongest prolongational connection possible among the events in
the two largest levels of time-span reduction represented in the region.
Events of less time-span importance need not be considered. In terms of
musical cognition, this means that patterns of tension and relaxation are
strongly organized by rhythmic articulation—an intuition that seems
obvious, but to our knowledge has not previously been formulated ex-
plicitly in the theoretical literature. The power of the Interaction Princi-
ple in constraining possible prolongational reductions makes it a central
part of our theory.
