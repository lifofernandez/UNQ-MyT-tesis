tion could be made. An extremely restrictive account would claim that
auditory stream segregation is an independent phenomenon that happens
to have an effect on musical perception just at this point. By contrast, an
extremely comprehensive account would claim that the rules of time-
span reduction are completely subsumed by more general principles of
auditory perception, and thus that the rule resulting in fusion in the Bach
suite is just a special case of the principle of auditory stream segregation.
We suspect that the truth lies somewhere berween these two extremes—
that the rules of time-span reduction are in part determined by general
properties of auditory perception, but that there is a certain degree of
specialization for musical cognition. Section 12.3 discusses this issue fur-
ther, presenting evidence from linguistics bearing on the cognitive gener-
ality of rules for time-span reduction.

Transformation
A process somewhat rarer than fusion occurs in 7.13a, part of the Bach
chorale “O Haupt.”

Within the bracketed time-span, neither of the two surface pitch-events is
heard as the structurally more important, as ordinary reduction would
require. Rather, as suggested in section 6.6, the head of this time-span is a
hypothetical root-position E minor chord, composed out of mutually
consonant fragments of the two-surface events in the time-span.

Example 7.13b illustrates the representation we adopt. The hypothet-
ical chord is inserted in brackets into the musical surface, between the
two events out of which it is constructed; the tree represents both actual
events as directly subordinate to the hypothetical one. In this situation we
will call the head of the time-span a transformation of the events within
the time-span.*

Like fusion, transformation occurs only at quite local levels of reduc-
tion. Again, we provisionally incorporate a restriction into the well-
formedness rule to express this fact.

Cadential Retention

Sections 6.3 and 6.4 observed that there is one situation in which more
than a single event is retained in a step of reduction: at a full or deceptive
