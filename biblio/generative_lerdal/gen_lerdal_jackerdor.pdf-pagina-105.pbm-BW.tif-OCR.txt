the preference for regularity, especially binary regularity, remains. Ap-
parently there is a preference rule operating at these levels—the metrical
counterpart of the grouping rule of symmetry (GPR 5$):

MPR 10 (Binary Regularity) Prefer metrical structures in which at each
level every other beat is strong.

MPR 10 allows metrical irregularity, but, in the absence of other infor-
mation, imposes duple meter. This seems to reflect musical intuition
about hypermetrical structure. At smaller metrical levels, the more rigid
requirements of MWFR 4 obscure the effects of MPR 10, since such levels
will be all duple or all triple (that is, either completely obeying or com-
pletely violating MPR 10).

A second kind of metrical irregularity is the result not of irregular
group lengths but of grouping overlaps and elisions. It comes in two
varieties. The first gives the impression of a jarring metrical readjustment.
An example is the passage from Haydn's Symphony no. 104 quoted in
section 3.4 in connection with its grouping elision, repeated here as 4.47.

Beneath the example appear the grouping and metrical structures from
the half-note (tactus) level up. At the point of grouping elision, the metri-
cal structure is distorted: a beat at the four-measure level occurs only
three measures after the previous one. Such a metrical distortion com-
monly occurs in conjunction with left elision in the grouping structure.

The association with elision suggests that a part of the metrical struc-
ture, in this case the time-span of a measure, has been deleted from an
otherwise regular metrical structure, along with the elided pitch-events.?
The alteration can be represented as in 4.48; the parenthesized beats on
the left are deleted. In effect, the strong beat comes too soon.

A second and more rare kind of metrical deletion gives the intuitive
effect of a retrospective awareness that a metrical shift has taken place.
An example occurs in the last seven measures of the Schumann song
“Wehmut,” from Liederkrets, op. 39, shown in 4.49.10

At the point of grouping overlap (not elision this time) the voice part
must end on a weak beat of the dotted-half level; however, the same
point must function as a strong beat of that level with respect to the piano
postlude, and this does not become clear until the following measure. The
effect in the analysis of the musical surface is a metrical structure con-
taining two weak beats in a row at the measure level. Again the coales-
cence of underlying pitch-events in the overlap suggests a corresponding
