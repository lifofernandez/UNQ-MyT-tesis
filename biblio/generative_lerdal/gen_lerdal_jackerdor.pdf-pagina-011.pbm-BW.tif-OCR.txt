The Connection
with Artistic
Concerns

Some readers may object to our use of linguistic methodology in studying
an art form. One might argue that everyone speaks a language, but not
everyone composes or performs music. However, this argument misses
the point. For one thing, we are focusing on the listener because listen-
ing is a much more widespread musical activity than composing or per-
forming. Composers and performers must be active listeners as well. And
even if not every member of a culture listens to music, those who do are
exercising a cognitive capacity; it is this capacity that we are investigat-
ing. (The fact that not everyone swims is not a deterrent to a physiologi-
cal study of swimming.)

A related objection is that, whereas music characteristically functions
as art, language does not. The data for linguistic study are the sentences
of the everyday world, for which there is no musical counterpart. At first
blush, poetry or drama would seem to provide a closer analogy to music.
However, we feel that traditional comparisons berween poetry or drama
and music, though perhaps valuable in particular instances, have neces-
sarily been superficial as a general theoretical approach. Our attitude
toward artistic questions is somewhat different. In order to appreciate the
poetic or dramatic structure of a poem in French, one must first under-
stand the French language. Similarly, to appreciate a Beethoven quartet
as art, one must understand the idiom of tonal music (where “under-
stand” is taken in the unconscious sense discussed above).

Music theory that is oriented toward explicating masterpieces tends to
address primarily those aspects of musical structure that are complex,
ambiguous, or controversial. But such discussion takes for granted a vast
substrate of totally “obvious” organization that defines the terms in
Which artistic options or questions are stated. For example, it rarely
seems worth special mention that a piece is in a certain meter, that
such-and-such is a motive, that a certain pitch is ornamental, and so
forth. Throughout this study we come to grips with such musically mun-
dane matters as a basis for understanding the more complex phenomena
that an “artistic” theory deems worthy of interest.

Uninteresting though such an enterprise may at first seem, it has
proved to us to yield two important benefits in the understanding of
music. First, one comes to realize how intricate even the “obvious” as-
pects of musical organization are—perhaps more complex than any
extant mathematically based conceptions of musical structure. These as-
pects only seem simple because their complexity is unconscious and
hence unnoticed. Second, one can begin to see how artistically interesting
phenomena result from manipulation of the parameters responsible for
“obvious” intuitions. Many interesting treatments of motivic-thematic
processes, such as Meyer's (1973) “implicational” theory, Epstein's
(1979) “Grundgestalt” organization, and aspects of Schenkerian analy-
sis, rely on an account of what pitches in a piece are structurally im-
portant. In the present study we show how the notion of structural
