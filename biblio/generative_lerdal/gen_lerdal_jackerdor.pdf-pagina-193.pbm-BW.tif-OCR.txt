Although the trees in 8.13 look similar, they have contrasting interpre-
tations: 8.13a expresses the arc of tonal motion from the piece's struc-
tural beginning to its cadence; 8.13b says first that the piece forms a
relaxing prolongation of the tonic and second that the opening I tenses
into the V, which in turn relaxes—more strongly than the previous
tensing—into the final I.

Tree 8.13b represents the prolongational basic form for a typical tonal
piece. It is grammatically complete in the sense that it expresses both
tonic prolongation and cadential resolution. This form appears not only
for whole pieces but— when considered in isolation—also for subordi-
nate grouping levels such as theme groups, periods, and phrases. Much of
the unity of tonal music depends on this fact.

Consequently, we can also consider 8.13b to represent the skeleton for
a typical antecedent-conseguent period in “interruption form.” If the
time-span analysis for the period yields the structure shown in 8.14a,
then 8.14b 1s the prolongational basic form corresponding to levels a and
b of 8.14a. The next events available for prolongational analysis are the
half-cadential V and the opening I of the consequent (level c in 8.14a).
Although the sheer geometry of the tree permits these two events to
connect in a large number of ways, we will consider only a few represen-
tative alternatives.
