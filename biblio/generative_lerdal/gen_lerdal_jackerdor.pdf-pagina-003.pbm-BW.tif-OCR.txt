however, that we have gone far enough to be able to present a coherent
and convincing overall view.

The book can be read from several perspectives. From the viewpoint of
music theory as traditionally conceived it offers many technical innova-
tions, not only in notation but also in the substance of rhythmic and
reductional theory and the relation between the two. We feel that our
approach has succeeded in clarifying a number of issues that have con-
cerned recent tonal theory.

We hope that this work will interest a wider circle of readers than the
usual treatise on music theory. As we develop our rules of grammar, we
often attempt to distinguish those aspects of the rules that are peculiar to
classical Western tonal music from those aspects that are applicable to a
wide range of musical idioms. Thus many parts of the theory can be
tested in terms of musical idioms other than the one we are primarily
concerned with here, providing a rich variety of questions for historical
and ethnomusicological research.

Beyond purely musical issues, the theory is intended as an investigation
of a domain of human cognitive capacity. Thus it should be useful to
linguists and psychologists, Â¡f for no other purpose than as an example of
the methodology of linguistics applied to a different domain. We believe
that our generative theory of music can provide a model of how to
construct a competence theory (in Chomsky's sense) without being crip-
pled by a slavish adherence to standard linguistic formalisms. In some
respects our theory has turned out more like certain contemporary work
in the theory of vision than like linguistic theory.

Our approach has led to the discovery of substantive as well as meth-
odological connections among music, language, and vision. Some of
these connections appear in the course of the theory's exposition (espe-
cially in sections 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, and 7.2), but we have reserved for chapter
12 a discussion of those connections that strike us as most significant.
The matters treated there suggest that our theory is of more than
peripheral interest to the cognitive sciences.

The exposition of the book reflects the diversity of its audience. On
occasion we elaborate fairly obvious musical points for the sake of
nonspecialists; more often we go into technical issues more deeply than
nonspecialists may care for. Readers should feel free to use the book as
their interests dictate. Linguists and psychologists should probably read
chapters 1, 3, 11, 12, and the beginning of chapter 5 first. Musicians may
want to start with chapters 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 11. All readers should bear in
mind that the heart of the theory resides in the chapters on formalization:
3,4,7, and9.

In the course of working out our ideas we have benefited greatly from
the writings of Noam Chomsky, Edward T. Cone, Grosvenor Cooper
and Leonard B. Meyer, Andrew Imbrie, Arthur J. Komar, David Lewin,
Charles Rosen, Carl Schachter, Heinrich Schenker, Peter Westergaard,
