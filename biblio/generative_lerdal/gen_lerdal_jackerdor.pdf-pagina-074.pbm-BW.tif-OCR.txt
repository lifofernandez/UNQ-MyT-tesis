(well formed)

MWER 4 holds for the smaller levels of metrical structure in tonal mu-
sic, with such extremely rare exceptions as the second movement of
Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony (in five) and the third movement of
the Brahms C Minor Trio op. 101 (in seven), In much of tonal music this
metrical regularity also obtains beyond the measure level, producing reg-
ular “hypermeasures” of two, four, and even eight measures.!

In music where regular hypermeasure metrical levels are sensed, certain
irregularities are heard as metrical deletions —violations of the metrical
regularity required by MWER 4. As with grouping overlaps and elisions,
we do not account for these irregularities by dropping MWER 4 alto-
gether; we add a transformational rule that modifies permissible metrical
structures in a constrained way. We deal with hypermeasure irregularities
and metrical deletions in section 4.5.

Second Approximation

There are some difficulties in the account of metrical structure given by
MWERs 1-4. This section shows that some of these have a common
source, and suggests some appropriate refinements,

First, we have assumed that each metrical level has evenly spaced beats.
In a passage played with rubato or with the numerous minute temporal
inflections added by a sensitive performer, spacing is uneven in the mu-
sical surface. Normally, however, the listener treats these local deviations
from the metrical pattern as though they did not exist; a certain amount
of metrical inexactness is tolerated in the service of emphasizing grouping
or gestural patterns. Though the study of such local metrical deviations is
of interest to the theory of musical cognition, we have nothing more to
say about it here.

A problem that we will deal with, however, is an overexplicitness in the
notation for metrical structure. Consider a piece with predominantly
quarter-note and eighth-note motion, but with an occasional sixteenth
note—the Mozart A Major Sonata again is a good example. Because of
the presence of the sixteenth notes, the MWERs require an overly fussy
sixteenth-note level throughout the piece, as shown in 4.4.
