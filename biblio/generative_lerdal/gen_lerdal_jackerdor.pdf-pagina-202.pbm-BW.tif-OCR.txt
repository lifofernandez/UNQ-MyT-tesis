Rather, a tonal phrase or piece almost always begins in relative repose,
builds toward tension, and relaxes into a resolving cadence (8.26d). This
is the most essential way in which the idiom achieves the aesthetic effects
of balance and closure (8.26a—8.26c would all give an “open-ended”
effect).

We would like now to make explicit the minimal branching condition,
which we will call normative prolongational structure, for this tensing-
relaxing pattern in tonal music.

First, it should be clear from the “global” treatment of the consequent
phrase in 8.25c that the branches of the prolongationally most important
events in a phrase or section need not necessarily attach directly. Whether
or not they connect depends on their function in the overall context.
Therefore, as suggested by 8.27a, such attachment is not a requirement
for normative prolongational structure.

Second, it was demonstrated above that a “subdominant” cadential
preparation plus a full cadence produces a double left-branching progres-
sion. Since this is the norm for closure in tonal music, let us provisionally
stipulate that the relaxing part of normative structure demands the struc-
ture in 8.27b. Finally, at least one significant right-branching progression
is needed to provide sufficient tension to balance the relaxing pattern in
