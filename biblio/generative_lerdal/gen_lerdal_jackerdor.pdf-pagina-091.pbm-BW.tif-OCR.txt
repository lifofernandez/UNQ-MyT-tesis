pitch-events, so they are marked by MPR $a. The strongest application of
MPR Sc (length of slur) is at beat 11, the beginning of the longest slur.
Beat 11 is also the only place where MPRs Sa and Sc reinforce each other.
A consistent pattern of articulation—two quarter notes in a row—be-
gins at beats 11 and 27, so MPR 5d applies at those points. Pitch prolon-
gations into the next beat are marked by MPR Se at beats 19, 23, and 27;
again the harmonic change is marked at beat 27.

In addition to the rule applications marked, MPR 1 (parallelism) re-
quires that each pattern of two eighths followed by a quarter receive the
same metrical structure. This requires that strong beats of the quarter-
note level be spaced two quarter notes apart.

In trying to find a half-note level that minimizes overall MPR viola-
tions, we see that MPRs Sa and Sc alternate throughout much of the
passage, superficially giving the appearance of a predicted ambiguity. But
we saw in 4.33a that MPR $a overrides Sc in such an environment; hence
rule violations are minimized if beats of the half-note level are placed
where MPR $a applies. This fits the multiple applications of rules at beats
11 and 27 and the bass attacks at 3, 11, 19, and 27, so that the half-note
level shown is quite stable throughout.

Next consider MPR applications at the half-note level. First, MPR 3
applies straightforwardly to the melody, giving again the clusters of three
adjacent applications separated by one beat. As before, the most favor-
able analysis of this is to place strong beats on the endpoints of the
clusters. Second, the bass attacks strengthen the application of MPR 3 at
beats 3, 11, 19, and 27, further weighting the analysis toward the end-
points of the clusters. Third, the harmonic change again triggers MPR Sf
at beat 27. Fourth, parallelism again requires a duple pattern. Fifth, in the
time-span reduction the beginning of the melody has been reduced to a
sequence of half-note Ds by this level, so the pitch-repetition rule
(MPR $e) applies at beat 3.

At the whole-note level, the time-span repetition of D beginning at beat
3 and the harmonic change at 27 are again relevant. But since parallelism
requires the two halves of the passage to be the same metrically, this
evidence is globally inconsistent, and one rule must give way. The deci-
sion in favor of treating beats 11 and 27 as strong is favored by the
relative strength of the harmonic rhythm rule and reinforced by factors
discussed in the next subsection. We have thus successfully derived the
desired metrical structure for this passage.

This section discusses briefly four further metrical preference rules and
the analysis of a more complex example.
Effects of Bass, Cadence, Suspension, and Time-Span Reduction

The first of the four rules deals specifically with polyphonic factors. In
tonal music, the bass tends to be metrically more stable than the upper
