18-—19, and that these group boundaries did not appear to correspond to
intuition. Consider transition 8—9; 18-19 is treated similarly. GPR 6 is
implicated in the suppression of this potential boundary by detecting the
parallelism between the sequences of events at transitions 1-3, 4—6, and
7—9. 1f a group boundary appeared at transition 8-—9, parallelism would
require it at 2-3 and 5-6 as well. But this would in turn make notes 3
and 6 form single-note groups, in violation of GPR 1. Hence the only way
to preserve parallelism is to suppress the possible group boundary at 8-—9.
Indirectly, then, GPR 6 overrides the slur/rest rule here.

The parallelism rule is not only important in establishing intermediate-
level groupings such as those in the brief examples examined here; it is
also the major factor in all large-scale grouping. For example, it recog-
nizes the parallelism between the exposition and the recapitulation of a
sonata movement, and assigns them parallel groupings at a very large
level, establishing major structural boundaries in the movement.

Finally, a seventh preference rule for grouping is concerned primarily
with influencing large-scale grouping. Different choices in sectionaliza-
tion of a piece often result in interesting differences in the time-span and
prolongational reductions, and often the choice cannot be made purely
on the basis of grouping evidence. Rather, the choice of preferred group-
ing must involve the relative stability of the resulting reductions, Without
a full account of the reductions we obviously cannot motivate such a
preference rule here, but we state it for completeness; it plays a role in
several analyses in chapter 10.

GPR 7 (Time-Span and Prolongational Stability) Prefer a grouping
structure that results in more stable time-span and/or prolongational
reductions.

Having stated the system of GPRs, we conclude this section with a few
remarks on the notion of parallelism mentioned in GPR 6 and on the
nature of the formalism used in stating our rules. The grouping prefer-
ence rules are applied to two other brief examples in section 3.6.

Remarks on Parallelism

The importance of parallelism in musical structure cannot be overesti-
mated. The more parallelism one can detect, the more internally coherent
an analysis becomes, and the less independent information must be pro-
cessed and retained in hearing or remembering a piece. However, our
formulation of GPR 6 still leaves a great deal to intuition in its use of the
locution “parallel.”

When two passages are identical they certainly count as parallel, but
how different can they be before they are judged as no longer parallel?
Among the factors involved in parallelism are similarity of rhythm, simi-
larity of internal grouping, and similarity of pitch contour. Where one
passage is an ornamented or simplified version of another, similarity of
