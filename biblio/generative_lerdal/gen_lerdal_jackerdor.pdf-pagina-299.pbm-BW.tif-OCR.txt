Tonic

The second element of a system of tonality is the designation of a par-
ticular member of the pitch collection as the major point of stability, or
tonic. (Some authors have used the term “basis tone” to avoid any impli-
cations of classical Western tonality.) All other pitches are heard in terms
of their relation to this pitch, and it is normally the pitch on which a piece
must end. In addition, there may be another designated pitch that serves
as a secondary point of stability, which, following Nettl 1973, we will
call the “dominant.” In classical Western tonal music it is a fifth above
the tonic, but in other traditions other intervals appear. For example, in
different Indian ragas the “dominant” (samvad1) is often a fourth or a
fifth above the tonic (vadi); in Torah chant, the “dominant,”” where “half
cadences” end, is a second above the tonic.

Different scales may result from choosing different members of the
pitch collection as tonic. For example, the range of medieval modes
results in large part from designating different members of the same pitch
collection as tonic. The same principle applies in deriving various Indian
ragas (scales) from a single tháta (pitch collection).

The claim that all pitches of a piece are heard in relation to the tonic
can be concretely demonstrated in the many musical traditions where the
melodic line is accompanied by a drone, which is invariably pitched on
the tonic and/or “dominant.” But even where the tonic is not blatantly
present in this fashion, its identity is usually clear from such factors as the
nature of cadential structure and the overall shape of melodic lines. Fur-
thermore, if the reduction hypothesis of chapter 5 is correct, the most
background level of reduction for every piece is a statement of the tonic;
hence the tonic is in some sense implicit in every moment of the piece.

Measure of Relative Stability

The third element of a system of tonality is a measure of relative stability
(or, broadly speaking, of relative consonance and dissonance) for various
pitch configurations. We have already discussed above the limited ex-
tent to which the overtone series influences criteria of intervallic stabil-
ity. Thus many aspects of a measure of stability will be a matter of
convention.

The simplest imaginable measure of stability would include only one
distinction: that between the tonic and any other pitch. The tonic would
be stable, and all other pitches equally unstable. In such an idiom, the
tonal system as such would place no constraints on the choice of pitches
within a piece, except for the last note, which, presuming a piece must
end stably, would have to be the tonic. Van der Werf 1972 argues that the
chansons of the thirteenth-century trouvéres are a case of this kind of
tonal organization.

In classical Western tonal music, the principles of relative stability are
highly elaborated. There are three distinct sorts of principles involved,
