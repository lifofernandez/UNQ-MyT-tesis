The other stumbling block to Gestalt theory was a lack of formalism.
Generative formalisms modeling mental representation had not yet been
developed, so a physically based treatment was probably the only way
available for going beyond the informality of most Gestalt theorizing.
Needless to say, this too no longer presents a problem. Although the
formalisms of transformational grammar do not lend themselves to the
purposes of visual theory, certain recent work in psychology can be
viewed as steps toward a generative theory of vision.

Suppose we think of a theory of vision as a description of the viewer's
ability to comprehend the presented visual field. Among the components
of such a theory will be a theory of visual structure, an abstract organiza-
tion that, like musical structure, is mentally generated but attributed to or
projected onto the presented field. This structure is the visual world as
perceived, that 1s, the terms in which visual experience presents itself to
consciousness. The possibilities for visual structure will be described by
principles analogous to musical well-formedness rules.

In addition, the theory will need to describe the mapping berween the
presented visual field and visual structure. In general, the presented evi-
dence will underdetermine the choice of visual structure; that is, the
visual field will in general be highly ambiguous. Therefore the mapping
function will have to include a system of preferences that choose the most
highly favored analysis or analyses for a presented visual field. The Ge-
stalt laws of organization can be construed as informal statements of
various aspects of this system of preferences.

More recent work illustrates parts of such a theory. The detailed topo-
logical constraints of Shiman (1975, 1978) are involved in the definition
of a well-formed visual structure; they essentially guarantee the orderly
decomposition of a field into regions by placing global conditions on the
network of boundaries that establish the decomposition. By working
through the mathematical consequences of the visual intuition that a
boundary is “oriented” (that it belongs specifically to only one of the
regions that it adjoins), Shiman derives, among other things, the possi-
bility of certain classical visual figure-ground ambiguities and the impos-
sibility of a three-dimensional interpretation for certain well-known
“impossible figures.”

The research cited in Shepard 1980 and the theory presented there are
very close in spirit to the sketch of visual theory given above. Shepard
states clearly the need for a theory of internal mental representation of
the visual field upon which computations such as “mental rotations” can
be performed. He further shows the necessity for a system of preferences
because of the underdetermination of representation by the visual field.
Shepard's approach is to derive preferred structures in terms of a metric
over a topological manifold whose dimensions correspond, in our frame-
work, to the domains of preference rules. He also alludes to musical
