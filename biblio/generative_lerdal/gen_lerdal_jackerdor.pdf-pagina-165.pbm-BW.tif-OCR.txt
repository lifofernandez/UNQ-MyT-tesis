points of stability defined through the diatonic collection and relative and
parallel major-minor relationships. (See sections 9.4 and 11.5 for further
discussion.)

These two measures of relative stability interact in what is by now the
expected fashion. For example, a root-position V chord is intrinsically
more stable than a I5, but the latter is closer to the tonic. Hence a choice
between these two is less highly determined than a choice between, say, a
T anda VS, where the two kinds of stability reinforce each other. The
preference rule can therefore be stated as follows:

TSRPR 2 (Local Harmony) Of the possible choices for head of a time-
span T, prefer a choice that is

a. relatively intrinsically consonant,

b. relatively closely related to the local tonic.

Example 7.17, the opening of “O Haupt,” illustrates TSRPR 2 in some
detail. In the stages of reduction given, TSRPR 1 is consistently overruled.
In the first half of measure 1, the IV and the I are approximately in
balance with respect to the factors of TSRPR 2, but voice-leading consid-
erations favor the I5, In the augmented time-span, the anacrusis I is
