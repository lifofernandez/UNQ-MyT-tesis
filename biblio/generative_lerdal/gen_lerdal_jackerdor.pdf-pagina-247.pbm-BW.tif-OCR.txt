unstable left-branching weak prolongation. On the other hand, f the V in
measure 8 is chosen first, measure 9 is attached as a right-branching
prolongation, a more stable result overall. In other words, the relative
weighting of prolongational connections favors making measure 8 a
point of arrival for the first section, of which measure 9 is a continuation,
rather than treating measure 8 as an anticipation of the second section.

Though it would be interesting to pursue this example further, we are
concerned for the moment only with the larger aspects of the form.
However, it is worth noting that, when the additional branches are filled
in, the tree will satisfy the normative form (with the parenthesized Classi-
cal options in PRPR 6 omitted). Note that each section individually as
well as the whole piece satisfies the structure, that neither section 1s a
tonic prolongation, and that the prolongational beginning of the second
section (the V in measure 9) is not directly connected to the prolonga-
tional ending. These three considerations further illustrate the flexibility
of normative structure.

The antecedent-conseguent and binary forms contain most of the ele-
ments necessary for constructing a prolongational skeleton for a move-
mentin sonata-allegro form. Figure 9.29 presents a harmonic sketch for a
typical example, with its grouping and time-span reduction. The double
bar between the exposition and development is notated for convenience.?
