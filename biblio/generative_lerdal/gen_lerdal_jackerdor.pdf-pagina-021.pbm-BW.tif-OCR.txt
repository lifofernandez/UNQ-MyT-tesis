2.2
Metrical Structure

More generally, the web of motivic associations (and of textural and
timbral associations as well) —let us call it associational structure—is a
highly important dimension in the understanding of a piece. But this web
is not hierarchical in the restricted sense described above, and it must not
be confused with grouping structure. It is a different dimension of mu-
sical structure, one that interacts with grouping structure. Because asso-
ciational structure is not hierarchical, however, our theory at present has
little to say about it. (See further remarks in section 11.4.)

To sum up: Grouping structure is hierarchical in a nonoverlapping
fashion (with the one exception mentioned above), it is recursive, and
each group must be composed of contiguous elements. These conditions
constitute a strong hypothesis about the nature of musical cognition with
respect to grouping. As will be seen, they are all the more significant in
that they also pertain to the other three components of the theory.

Kinds of Accent

Before discussing metrical structure (the regular, hierarchical pattern of
beats to which the listener relates musical events), we must clarify the
concept of accent. Vague use of this term, often in connection with meter,
has caused much confusion. In our judgment it is essential to distinguish
three kinds of accent: phenomenal, structural, and metrical. By phenom-
enal accent We mean any event at the musical surface that gives emphasis
or stress to a moment in the musical flow. Included in this category are
attack points of pitch-events, local stresses such as sforzandi, sudden
changes in dynamics or timbre, long notes, leaps to relatively high or low
notes, harmonic changes, and so forth. By structural accent we mean an
accent caused by the melodic/harmonic points of gravity in a phrase or
section—especially by the cadence, the goal of tonal motion. By metrical
accent We mean any beat thatis relatively strong in its metrical context.?

Phenomenal, structural, and metrical accents relate in various ways.
Section 2.4 deals with the interaction of structural and metrical accents,
and chapter 4 is concerned in detail with the relation of phenomenal
accent to metrical accent. Nonetheless, a general characterization of the
latter relation is now in order, if only because it will help locate the
conception of metrical structure in concrete experience.

Phenomenal accent functions as a perceptual input to metrical ac-
cent—cthat is, the moments of musical stress in the raw signal serve as
“cues” from which the listener attempts to extrapolate a regular pattern
of metrical accents. f there is little regularity to these cues, or if they
conflict, the sense of metrical accent becomes attenuated or ambiguous. I£
on the other hand the cues are regular and mutually supporting, the sense
of metrical accent becomes definite and multileveled. Once a clear metri-
cal pattern has been established, the listener renounces it only in the face
of strongly contradicting evidence. Syncopation takes place where cues
