It is important that PRPR 6 does not specify the harmonic function of
the prolongational beginning and ending of a cadenced group. In partic-
ular, they need not form any sort of prolongation. The prolongational
beginning may be a right branch off some earlier event to which the
prolongational ending does not connect directly. Such a situation is
found in a number of examples already discussed (for instance the con-
sequent of the antecedent-consequent patrern in 9.9b). Moreover, a
phrase that modulates may satisfy normative structure. All that is neces-
sary 1s that the requisite right- and left-branching progressions be present.
Example 9.23 illustrates the normative structure in the modulating third
phrase of “O Haupt.”

Normative Structure and the Ursatz

In appearance, the prolongational basic form approximates the Ursatz
of Schenkerian theory. In function, however, the concept of normative
structure may play a role more comparable to the Ursatz, in that norma-
tive structure specifies an obligatory pattern that must be fulfilled for a
passage to be musically complete. But the statement of the rule in terms
of branchings rather than specific progressions allows it to apply to a
