wider range of situations than the Ursatz. The modulating phrase just
cited is a simple example. A more complex example appears in 9.24, a
harmonic sketch of the Chopin A Major Prelude, part of whose time-
span reduction was presented in 7.23 and 7.24. This is an entire piece
that satisfies normative structure but is an instance of neither the basic
form nor the Ursatz.

We will first derive the prolongational tree in 9.24, then discuss the
musical consequences of the analysis. We assume the time-span reduction
given in example 7.24, in which the initial V is the structural beginning of
the piece. (As mentioned there, another interpretation is possible in
Which the first 1 chord is the structural beginning.)

Since the initial V forms a stable progression to the prolongational
head, the final 1, it is selected as the highest branch off the head. The next
most time-span-important event is the V of the final cadence. In terms of
prolongational connection alone, this could attach either as a prolonga-
tion of the initial V or as a progression to the final L But time-span
congruence (PRPR 2), prolongational importance of the endpoints (PRPR
4), and above all the cadential structure stipulated by PRPR 6 favor the
latter attachment. This yields a structure with the geometry of the basic
form but not its specific harmonic content: it is V-V-I rather than
I-V-â€”L

The next attachment is the V in measures 9-10, which becomes a
prolongation of the initial V. Within the region from this V to the end
(the second phrase), the V/ii and the ii in measures 12-13 form a de-
scending circle-of-fifths progression to the cadential V (PRPR 3) and so
