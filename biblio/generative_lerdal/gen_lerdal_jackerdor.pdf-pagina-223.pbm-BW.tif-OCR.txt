For a more complex but similar case consider 9.4c, in which e, has
been chosen as the most important event between e; and e¡; assume that
e, has turned out to be a direct elaboration of e,. Then the passage from
e7 to e, is divided up into two regions: (e>—e ,) and (e,—e ). Let us focus
on the geometry of the latter of these regions.

Suppose that the prolongationally most important event in (es—e )
turns out to be e;. As shown in 9.4d, e; could conceivably be attached in
any of three ways: to e, to e», orto e. However, if it is attached to e, the
prohibition against crossing branches means that it must be attached
higher than e ,, and hence that it is prolongationally more important than
e. But this violates the assumption that e, was the most important event
in (e4—e ). Therefore, e; may be attached only to e, or e ¡ ¡f the musical
meaning of the tree is to be preserved.

For the most complex case, suppose that e; in 9.4d turns out to be
attached to e, as 1n 9.4e. Then, in the region (e,—es), the prolongation-
ally most important event e5 can geometrically be attached in four differ-
ent places: to e, e2, €1, and e;. But attachment to e, would require e; to
be more important than e,, violating assumptions; and attachment to e,
would require e; to be more important than es, again violating assump-
tions. Hence only attachment to e, or e; is possible.

This exercise has established the general procedure for constructing a
prolongational tree. The prolongational head e; establishes two initial
regions, (4*-—e ) and (e,—%), of which the second is empty if ej is at the
very end. We find the prolongationally most important events in each of
these regions and attach them to e, dividing the piece into at most four
regions. In each of these regions, we find the prolongationally most im-
portant event and attach it to one of the events that bound the region
from which it has been chosen. These then divide the regions in which
they were chosen into further regions, and so forth. In general, an event
chosen as the most important event in a region (e;—e;) must be a direct
elaboration of either e; or e;; it cannot be a direct elaboration of some-
thing e; or e; is attached to. If one endpoint of a region is *, the most
important event in the region must be a direct elaboration of its other
endpoint.

Having worked out this procedure, we can now define a prolonga-
tional region in a simple and general fashion:

A prolongational region is a sequence of events (e;—e;), (*-—e)), or (e;—%)
such that all events within the sequence are recursive elaborations of
either e; or e;.

The reader can easily verify that this definition is valid for all the prolon-
gational regions illustrated in 9.4. In particular, in the most complex case
(9.4e), e; must be a direct elaboration of either e, or e5; and events chosen
subsequently between e, and e; must in turn be elaborations of e,, es, Or
e5 (that is, recursive elaborations of either e, or e-).
