detail to the most long-range connection. Most likely, he will hear fairly
accurately the details (except when his mind wanders) and the largest
connections, but will be vague about some of the intervening relation-
ships. A complete reduction of the Eroica is in this sense an idealization.

A final remark on the need for reductions: The Gestalt psychologists,
for example Koffka (1935), recognized transposition of a musical pas-
sage as a way of changing a musical surface that preserves recognizabil-
ity. They rook this as important evidence for a mental representation that
involves not just a list of pitches, but an abstract representation in which
relations among pitches are more important than the actual pitches them-
selves. However, for whatever reasons, comparatively little seems to have
been done within psychology to extend these observations in any
significant way (though a certain degree of generalization appears in
Dowling 1978, for example). The concepts, examples, and arguments
just presented are exactly the sort that should be of interest in this regard,
because they provide evidence for musical cognition of relationships not
just between events adjacent on the musical surface, but between struc-
turally important events at various reductiorral levels that are potentially
far apart on the musical surface. Thus the study of musical reductions
and of the processes producing them from musical surfaces is of great
value in extending to a richer class of cases what has long been acknowl-
edged as a psychologically important phenomenon.

If Schenkerian thought is central to the notion of reduction, and if there
are significant parallels between Schenkerian theory and generative lin-
guistics,? it seems logical to ask what is required to convert Schenkerian
theory into a formal theory. For example, one might set out to develop a
set of rules that would generate little pieces, perhaps without durational
values, from the triad to the Ursatz (the “fundamental structure,” made
up essentially of a tonic-dominant-tonic progression supporting a linear
melodic descent to the tonic note), and from there to simple harmonic
and contrapuntal elaborations. Such an enterprise, however, would be
utterly unrevealing from a psychological standpoint. “Generating” trivial
musical examples says nothing about how people hear.?

It would be more promising to take Schenkerian analyses of actual
tonal pieces—pieces that are intrinsically interesting as well as
sufficiently complex to be informative about cognitive processes—and
then to develop a rule system capable of generating these analyses. This
approach would reveal the lacunae in Schenkerian theory, and, generally,
would put the theory on a solid intellectual foundation.3 We might have
taken this tack, except that it seemed a doubtful strategy to launch a
theory of musical cognition by filling in the gaps in somebody else's
“artistic” theory, no matter how brilliant it may be in numerous respects.
