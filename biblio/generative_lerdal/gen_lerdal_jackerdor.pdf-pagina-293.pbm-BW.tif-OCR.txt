mally reinforce each other, within each component and across compo-
nents, will be heard as “archetypal.” As more conflict appears among
preference rules, the passage deviates more from archetypal form and is
heard as musically more complex.

Let us provisionally suggest some features of the archetypal phrase in
terms of the components of our theory:

1. Each larger-level group is divided into two groups of equal length.

2. The larger levels of metrical structure are uniformly duple.

3. The grouping and metrical structures are maximally in phase, in the
sense described in section 2.3. This not only excludes all but the
lowest-level upbeats, but also guarantees that the measure lengths of
groups are in powers of 2.

4. In the time-span reduction, the structural beginning of a phrase is its
first event and is a tonic chord in root position; the cadence of the
phrase is its last two events and is a tonic perfect cadence.

5. The prolongational reduction yields a normative structure, in the sense
described in sections 8.3 and 9.6.

6. The time-span and prolongational reductions are congruent, in the
sense described in section 5.4.

These six properties of archetypal phrases maximally satisfy those prefer-
ence rules that address the abstract structure of the phrase: grouping
symmetry (GPR 5), binary metrical regularity (MPR 10), correlation of
grouping and meter (MPR 2), choice of cadences and structural begin-
nings (TSRPRs 7 and 8), prolongational normative structure (PRPR 6),
and correlation of the two reductions (PRPRs 1 and 2). This list is not
exhaustive; moreover, one could find “archetypal” patterns emerging
from mutually reinforcing preference rules at levels both smaller and
larger than the phrase. In short, archetypal patterns are not represented
directly in the grammar, but emerge as ideally stable structural descrip-
tions produced by the grammar.

A further advantage of our approach to the issue of archetypes is thatiit
relates at every point to more general musical and psychological issues,
such as the relation of tonal music to other idioms, the distinction be-
tween learned and innate aspects of musical idioms, and the relation of
musical cognitive capacity to other cognitive capacities. A “deep struc-
tural” approach to archetypes could in principle address these issues, but
they are not a concern in the approaches we have seen; nor is it ar all
obvious to us how they could naturally be integrated into the formal
mechanisms these approaches imply. By contrast, the preference-rule
formalism was motivated from the start (section 3.2) on psychological
grounds.
