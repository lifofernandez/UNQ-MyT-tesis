Within the basic form, the most stable prolongational connection is the
strong prolongation from the beginning to the start of the recapitulation;
the Interaction Principle permits this to be chosen as the most important
event in the region, as shown in 9.30. Thus the presence of the recapitula-
tion results in a major difference in prolongational structure from the
binary form; the central dominant is no longer the most important event
in the interior of the piece, but is displaced by the tonic prolongation.

The prolongation in 9.30 breaks the piece into two prolongational re-
gions: the exposition and development together, and the recapitulation.
In the region consisting of the exposition and development, we have a
situation not unlike the binary form: the highest two levels of time-span
reduction contain only Vs and V/Vs, so there is no prominent tonic
prolongation. The most time-span-important events are the Vs surround-
ing the double bar. How should they be attached? For the same intuitive
and formal reasons as in the case of the central dominants in binary form,
the beginning of the development should be a right branch off the end of
the exposition. This leaves the two possibilities shown in 9.31. These are
equally consistent with stable prolongational connection as stated so far
(PRPR 3), but 9.31a is favored by time-span segmentation (PRPR 2) and
the prolongational importance of the initial I (PRPR 4).

In addition, the choice of 9.31a is reinforced by appeal to a distinction
among the structural functions of the dominant, not previously incorpo-
rated in the theory. As in the binary form, the Vs surrounding the double
bar are tonicized Vs; other key areas (most notably III in movements in
minor) can be substituted without changing the overall sense of the piece.
By contrast, the V at the end of the development is a half-cadential V; the
main substitution for it would be a full cadence whose resolution over-
lapped with the recapitulation.
