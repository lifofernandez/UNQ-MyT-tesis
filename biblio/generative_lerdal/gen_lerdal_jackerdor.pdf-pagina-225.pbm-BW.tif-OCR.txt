PRPR 1 addresses only the question of which event in a region is most
important, not that of which endpoint of the region that event is attached
to. Another preference rule deals with this second question in terms of
congruence with time-span segmentation: other things being equal, direct
prolongational elaborations should not cross time-span boundaries.

PRPR 2 (Time-Span Segmentation) Let e; be the prolongationally most
important event in a prolongational region (e;—e;). If there is a time-span
that contains e; and ex but not e;, prefer a prolongational reduction in
which e; is an elaboration of e;; similarly with the roles of e; and e;
reversed.

One prominent situation in which PRPR 2 applies is illustrated in 9.6.

In both 9.6a and 9.6b, assume that e; and e; are I chords and ey is a V
adjacent to the second I in the musical surface. However, as the group-
ings shown in the examples indicate, the V in 9.6a is a half cadence
preceding a new phrase beginning on I; by contrast, the V in 9.6b is the
dominant of a full cadence resolving on the final I, We argued in section
8.3 that the half cadence is heard as a departure from the initial I,
whereas the dominant of a full cadence is a left branch to its resolution.
PRPR 2 accounts for this difference in terms of the grouping difference
between 9.6a and 9.6b.

PRPR 2 is stated in terms of time-span segmentation rather than time-
span reduction branching, in order to accommodate instances in which
the branching cannot possibly be congruent yet time-span considerations
still affect prolongational branching. Example 9.7 presents a typical case;
