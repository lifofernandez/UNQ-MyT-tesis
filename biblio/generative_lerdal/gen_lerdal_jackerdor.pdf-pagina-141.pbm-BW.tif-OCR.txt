the head of the phrase. In the second phrase, by similar considerations,
the c instead is the head; and so forth. This process continues cyclically
from level to level. Finally, in 6.15d, the c dominates the b because the
ending of a piece is usually more stable than its beginning.

Pitch relations among bs and cs can reinforce or undermine this
scheme. If, for instance, the b of the first phrase were far less stable than
1ts c (think, for example, of the opening of Beethoven's Sonata op. 31, no.
3), the c might emerge as the structurally most important event of the
phrase and thus be retained at larger levels instead of the b. In such a
case, pitch stability (the c) would override adjacency to a larger grouping
boundary (the b). Since these cases are exceptional, however, we will not
pursue them now; an example appears in section 7.4.

Example 6.16 compresses the information conveyed in 6.15. As a con-
venience, we give the subscript for only the largest level of grouping for
which a b or a c functions.

At these levels right and left branchings no longer express pitch-meter
relationships, but pitch-grouping relationships. The translation of 6.16
into the “ball-throwing” representation of 6.17 should clarify this point.

The arrows signify the arcs of tonal motion over which structural accents
function. In any time-span tree, large-scale branchings connecting bs and
es are always to be interpreted as arcs of tonal motion articulating group-
ing structure,
