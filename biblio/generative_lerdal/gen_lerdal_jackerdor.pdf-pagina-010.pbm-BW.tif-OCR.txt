adjective, preposition, noun phrase, and verb phrase. Finally, one should
not be misled by the fact that both music and language deal with sound
structure. There are no musical counterparts of such phonological pa-
rameters as voicing, nasality, tongue height, and lip rounding. (See also
section 11.4.)

The fundamental concepts of musical structure must instead involve
such factors as rhythmic and pitch organization, dynamic and timbral
differentiation, and motivic-thematic processes. These factors and their
interactions form intricate structures quite different from, but no less
complex than, those of linguistic structure. Any deep parallels that might
exist can be discussed meaningfully only after a music theory, in the sense
defined in the preceding section, has been developed independently. If we
have adopted some of the theoretical framework and methodology of
linguistics, it is because this approach has suggested a fruitful way of
thinking about music itself. If substantive parallels berween language and
music emerge (as they do in sections 4.2 and 12.3), this is an unexpected
bonus but not necessarily a desideratum.

To help clarify in what sense our theory is modeled after linguistic
methodology, we must mention some common misconceptions about
generative-transformational grammar. The early work in the field, such
as Chomsky 1957 and Lees 1960, took as its goal the description of “all
and only” the sentences of a language, and many were led to think of a
generative grammar as an algorithm to manufacture grammatical sen-
tences. Under this interpretation, a musical grammar should be an al-
gorithm that composes pieces of music.7

There are three errors in this view. First, the sense of “generate” in the
term “generative grammar” is not that of an electrical generator that
produces electricity, but the mathematical sense, in which it means to
describe a (usually infinite) set by finite formal means. Second, it was
pointed out by Chomsky and Miller (1963), and it has been an unques-
tioned assumption of actual research in linguistics, that what is really of
interest in a generative grammar is the structure it assigns to sentences,
not which strings of words are or are not grammatical sentences. The
same holds for our theory of music. It is not intended to enumerate what
pieces are possible, but to specify a structural description for any tonal
piece; that is, the structure that the experienced listener infers in his
hearing of the piece. A third error in the conception of a generative
grammar as a sentence-spewing device is not evident from passing ac-
quaintance with the early works of the generative school, but emerges as
a prominent theme of Chomsky 1965, Lenneberg 1967, and subsequent
work. Linguistic theory is not simply concerned with the analysis of a set
of sentences; rather it considers itself a branch of psychology, concerned
with making empirically verifiable claims about one complex aspect of
human life: language. Similarly, our ultimate goal is an understanding of
musical cognition, a psychological phenomenon.
