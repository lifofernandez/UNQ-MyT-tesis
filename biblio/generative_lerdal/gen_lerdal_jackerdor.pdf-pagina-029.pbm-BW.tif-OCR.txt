against conflicting new evidence; in a radical hearing he immediately
readjusts according to new evidence. Applied to measures 9-13, in-
terpretation A in 2.11 represents a conservative hearing. It retains the
previous pattern until it is forced to relinquish the downbeats of measures
13 and 15 in favor of the downbeats of measures 14 and 16 as strong.
This hearing has the advantage of giving the thematic structure in mea-
sures 10-11 the same metrical structure that it had in measures 2-3,
4-5, 6-7, and 8-9, andit lends significance to the motivically unique
thematic extension in measure 13— that is, the extension is not merely
thematic, but serves as well to bring about the metrical shift from the
downbeat of measure 13 to the downbeat of measure 14 as strong.
Interpretation B, on the other hand, represents a radical hearing: it im-
mediately reinterprets the harmonies in measures 10 and 12 as hyper-
metrical “appoggiatura chords,” thus setting up a parallelism with the
ensuing measure 14, We will refrain from choosing between these com-
peting alternatives; suffice it to say that in such ambiguous cases the
performer's choice, communicated by a slightly extra stress (in this case,
at the downbeat of either measure 10 or measure 11), can tip the balance
one way or the other for the listener.5

But if the 2-bar metrical level has proved so troublesome, what is one
to do with the 4-bar level? If the downbeats of measures 3 and 7 are beats
at this level, then the downbeats of measures 11, 16, and 20 appear to
follow (allowing for a S-bar time-span somewhere in the vicinity of mea-
sures 9-16 because of the adjustment at the 2-bar level). But it seems
implausible to give such a metrical accent to the downbeat of measure 11;
and two bars are unhappily left over berween measure 20 and measure
22. If, on the other hand, the downbeats of measures 5 and 9 are beats at
this level, then the downbeats of measures 14, 18, and 22 apparently
follow. But it stretches matters to hear a metrical accent at the downbeat
of measure 18, placed as it is in the middle of the dominant pedal in
measures 16—20. Neither alternative is satisfactory.

There is a third alternative: to posit a regular, more “normal” version
of these measures—a “model” —and derive the actual music from that.”
Butitis extremely difficult to know which model to construct, other than
somehow to make the downbeats of measures 16 and 22—Ethe major
points of harmonic arrival—strong beats at this level. In other respects
this exercise is so hypothetical that it would seem wise to give up the
attempt altogether. The 4-bar metrical level (not to mention larger levels)
simply does not have much meaning for this passage.

We have established that the basic elements of grouping and of meter are
fundamentally different: grouping structure consists of units organized
hierarchically; metrical structure consists of beats organized hierarchi-
cally. As we turn to the interaction of these two musical dimensions, it is
