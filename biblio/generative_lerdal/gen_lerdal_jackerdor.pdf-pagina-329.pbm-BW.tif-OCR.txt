but in the phrases ¿hirteen men and Tennessee aír their strongest stresses
are on the initial syllable. Liberman and Prince explicate the rule in terms
of a metrical structure not unlike the musical metrical structure described
in chapters 2 and 4.

The general idea behind the Rhythm Rule is that the stresses of a lin-
guistic phrase form a hierarchical metrical pattern, with relatively heavy
stresses corresponding to relatively strong beats and relatively weak
stresses corresponding to relatively weak beats. The ideal metrical struc-
ture is one in which relatively strong and relatively weak beats alternate;
in particular, two relatively strong beats are preferably not adjacent to
one another. Just such a situation arises in the juxtaposition of thirteen
with men and Tennessee with aír: the strongest stress is on the second
word, and the next strongest is on the final syllable of the first word. The
Rhythm Rule alters this undesirable situation by reversing the largest 1w
and s of the first word, thereby separating the second-strongest stress
from the strongest by a relatively weak stress. Thus, instead of 12.21a
and 12.21b (the tree structures one would expect given the stress patterns
of the individual words), the Rhythm Rule yields the structures in 12.21c
and 12.21d. Beneath the segmentation is the metrical structure (in our
notation) assigned to the tree; the number of dots below a syllable is
proportional to its relative prominence in the tree.

The Rhythm Rule can therefore be thought of as a rule that makes
prosodic structure conform more closely to an ideal metrical pattern.
Despite the differences in formulation, there is a clear kinship between
this rule and the rules relating metrical structure to time-span reduction
(MPR 9, TSRPR 1, and especially TSRPR 5). The major difference between
