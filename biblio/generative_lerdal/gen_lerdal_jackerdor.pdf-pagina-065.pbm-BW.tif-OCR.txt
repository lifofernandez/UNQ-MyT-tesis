When notating surface grouping structure, we designate grouping
overlaps by overlapping slurs beneath the music, as in 3.32a. When
notating underlying grouping structures, we join by a brace events that
come to be overlapped in the surface, as in 3.32b.

The formal rule for elision is almost exactly identical to that of overlap.
The only difference lies in the relationships of the boundary events e, e,
and e'. For the more common left elision (3.26), e (the underlying event
to be elided) is harmonically but not totally identical to e»; typically it is
at a lower dynamic and has a smaller pitch range. The corresponding
event in surface grouping structure, e', is identical to e. For right elision
(3.28), the roles of e, and ey are reversed. The description of a grouping
structure containing an elision thus contains in its underlying grouping
structure a description of the intuitively elided event.

Grouping Elision Given a well-formed underlying grouping structure G
as described by GWFRs 1-5, containing two adjacent groups g, and £»
such that
£1 ends with event e,,
22 begins with event e,, and
(for left elision) e; is harmonically identical to e, and less than e, in
dynamics and pitch range or
(for right elision) e; is harmonically identical to e, and less than e, in
dynamics and pitch range,
a well-formed surface grouping structure G' may be formed that is iden-
tical to G except that
it contains one event e' where G had the sequence e¡,e»,
(for left elision) e' = e»,
(for right elision) e' = e,
all groups ending with e, in G end with e' in G', and
all groups beginning with e; in G begin with e' in G'.

The rules for overlap and elision have the desired effect of expanding
the class of well-formed grouping structures to include the observed
counterexamples to GWEFR 4. In doing so, they express the musical intu-
itions behind these counterexamples and they restrict the predicted range
of counterexamples to three very specific related types.

In addition, the separation of underlying and surface grouping struc-
ture entailed by these rules will be advantageous in the description of the
