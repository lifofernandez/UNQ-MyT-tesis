and since more abstract forms of parallelism intimately involve reduc-
tional and metrical considerations, the evidence on which to base group-
ing judgments is predominantly that of local detail (GPRs 1-3). As a
consequence, little multileveled global grouping can be constructed be-
yond the most obvious textural divisions. And if local detail results in
irregular group lengths, metrical structure is further weakened through
the influence of grouping parallelism on meter (MPR 1). Some varieties of
contemporary music even cloud evidence for local grouping judgments.

In sum, to the degree that the applicability of these various aspects of
musical grammar is attenuated, the listener will infer less hierarchical
structure from the musical surface. As a result, nonhierarchical aspects of
musical perception (such as timbre and dynamics) tend to play a greater,
compensatory role in musical organization. But this is not compensation
in kind; the relative absence of hierarchical dimensions tends to result in
a kind of music perceived very locally, often as a sequence of gestures and
associations. Its complexity often resides in the extreme refinement of
individual nuances. Alternatively, many composers take recourse in con-
structing very complicated musical surfaces in terms of the sheer number
and variety of events per unit of time. This too is by way of compensation
for the lack of sufficient hierarchical organization, but is not a replace-
ment for it.

All of this discussion presupposes that the listener uses the principles of
musical cognition set forth in our theory for structuring his perception of
such music. One might alternatively suppose that he is using different
principles. What might these principles be? One possibility -is that he
is somehow capable of inferring the organization that the composer,
through his compositional method, has consciously built into the piece.
For example, a composer might use statistical principles of molecular
motion to determine compositional choices. We find it unlikely that the
listener can hear according to such radically different principles.$

A more plausible case might be made for serialism in pitch organiza-
tion as a possible principle of musical cognition. Let us see what this
would entail. First of all, serialism is a permutational system, in which the
function of each pitch is determined by its position within the complete
set (usually a twelve-tone row). This means that local elaboration of a
particular pitch is not an available option within the compositional tech-
nique in any direct way. Such ornamentation could be devised by adding
further principles to the system, but they would not be intrinsic to
serialism as such.

To be sure, serialism does provide means for elaborating structure, in
the form of basic operations on the set such as transposition, inversion,
and retrograde. These are global operations on the set as a whole, and as
such are transformational (in the technical sense) rather than phrase-
structure-like, as our trees are. Hence these operations provide only a set
of relationships among different occurrences of the set or portions of it;
