Binary Form

On the other hand, the complexity the rule engenders is not just gratu-
itous complication. Rather, because it is patterned in terms of levels of
structure, it produces a higher degree of coherence. Each event has a
specific and unique function in the whole, in a way that would not be true
of either a uniform string of events such as V-I-V-—I-... or a random
sequence. It may be inferred from other areas of cognition, such as vision
and language (see Koffka 1935; Neisser 1967; Fodor, Bever, and Garretr
1974), that this strong structuring of the parts into the whole enhances
comprehension and memory.

As additional illustrations of prolongational derivations, this section de-
velops trees for the major structural points in binary-form and sonata-
form movements.

Figure 9.27 is a harmonic sketch of the larger levels of time-span
reduction for a typical binary baroque dance form, Menuetto I of the
Bach G Major Cello Suite.

In such a piece, there is no important recurrence of I berween the very
beginning and the final cadence; thus there can be no large tonic prolon-
gation inside of the basic form. The most time-span-important events
within the basic form are the dominants in measures 8-9. How should
these be attached? Superficially, one might think that they form a domi-
nant prolongation to the final cadence, as in 9.28a. But such a structure
would claim, counterintuitively, that the tension of the piece begins to
defuse by the double bar (the midpoint of the piece). Moreover, in similar
pieces in the minor mode, such as the sarabande of the C Minor Cello
Suite, the point corresponding to measure 8 has the relative major instead
