Looking at a large variety of languages, Vergnaud and Halle (1979)
conclude that the rule for structuring the feet of an English word is
typical. The only major difference that appears is that in some languages
the gathering of feet begins at the left and works rightward, in the mirror
image of the English rule.$ Morris Halle has suggested (personal commu-
nication) that one should expect similar mirror-image phenomena in
time-span segmentation in music. Recall that the normal gathering of
subgroups into larger subgroups places the strong beat on the left. How-
ever, as mentioned at the end of section 7.1, there is a musical idiom in
Which the strong beat appears to be on the right end of subgroups: the
gamelan music described by Becker and Becker (1979). Hence the cross-
linguistic possibilities for foot formation parallel the cross-idiom possi-
bilities for subgroup formation.

The larger levels of the prosodic structure—phonological phrase, in-
tonational phrase, and utterance—have been less extensively studied
than syllables, feet, and words. Selkirk's preliminary work indicates that
the rules determining segmentation at these levels are not terribly differ-
ent from the rules discussed so far, except that they make use of syntactic
as well as phonological properties to establish boundaries.

To sum up: We find that prosodic structure, like time-span reduction,
is based on a segmentation of the surface string into a layered hierarchy.
Each layer (subgroups, uncadenced groups, and cadenced groups in mu-
sic; syllables, feet, words, and the like in language) in itself exhaustively
analyzes the string, and of course there may be more than one such level.

We next turn to the principles that define the possible trees associated
with a phonological segmentation.

Prosodic Well-Formedness Rules

The principles of segmentation apply in such a way that each segment at
each level immediately contains either one or two segments of the next
smaller level (this should be evident from examination of the structures in
12.12-12.16). Thus it is simple to construct a tree that reflects the seg-
mentation. Each of the smallest segments (syllables in the version of the
theory presented here) is attached to the bottom of a branch. If a segment
x is the only segment immediately contained in the segment of the next
larger level, nothing happens in the tree. If segments x and y are both
