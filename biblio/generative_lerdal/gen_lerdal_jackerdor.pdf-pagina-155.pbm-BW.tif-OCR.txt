In order to produce this segmentation, it suffices to change condition b of
segmentation rule 2 to include in 7;z the preceding rather than the
following time-span of the next smaller level. The possibility of such a
mirror reversal of the usual situation will be of particular interest when
time-span reduction is compared with phonological theory in section
12.3.

Given the rules for segmentation of the musical surface into time-
spans, we now turn to a formal description of the possible time-span
trees.
