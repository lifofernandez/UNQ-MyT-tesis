much as in the theory of musical structure. For example, there are no
necessary and sufficient conditions for a portion of the musical surface to
be judged a group. The grouping well-formedness conditions are neces-
sary conditions on groups, but not sufficient, Each preference rule is an
attribute that creates family resemblances among grouping structures,
but since every preference rule can be overridden by the proper conflu-
ence of circumstances, it is a sufficient condition only in the absence of
conflicting evidence. Where preference rules come into conflict, dubious
judgments of grouping result; where a great number of preference rules
reinforce each other, a stereotypical grouping structure results. Thus the
theory of preference rules accounts for the productivity of the system, the
existence of family resemblances, the existence of dubious judgments,
and the existence of stereotypical examples.

To see how directly this result bears on a theory of word meanings,
observe that the grammar of musical grouping presented in chapter 3 can
be taken as a theory of the meaning of the term (musical) group. One
would expect meanings of other words to be commensurately complex.
In particular, it is plausible that the well-formedness conditions would at
least fix the semantic field of a word. The preference rules would, among
other things, carry out discriminations along dimensions of continuous
variation. For example, color terms would presumably have well-
formedness conditions identifying them as denoting colors; the exact
discrimination among colors would be carried out by preference rules.
On the other hand, some classes of terms might lack any interesting
preference rules. Kinship terms, for instance (including terms of non-
kinship like bachelor), seem to be such that well-formedness conditions
on configurations of primitives such as male, female, descendant of, and
spouse of largely suffice. Thus we would expect the balance between
well-formedness and preference rules to differ from word to word, with
well-formedness rules never entirely absent.3

Other Phenomena
We mention briefly three other areas in which the characteristics of pref-
erence rules have been observed. One of these is phonetic perception.
Liberman and Studdert-Kennedy (1977) speak of a “trading relation”
among the acoustic cues that distinguish such phrases as gray ship, gray
chip, great ship, and great chip. In particular, the duration of the silence
after the vowel of the first word (between 0 and 100 milliseconds) and the
duration of the fricative “sh” noise (berween 60 and 180 milli-
seconds) must be evaluated in relation to each other in order to predict
which phrase is heard. This behavior closely resembles the assignment of
metrical weight in music, for example, where stress and length interact in
similar fashion.

Another area of grammar for which the notion of preference rules
seems especially apposite is the statement of markedness conventions:
