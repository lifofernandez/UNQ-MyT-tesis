pitch-event being an elaboration of another pitch-event; the latter is the
structurally more important event of the two. Thus a suspension is an
elaboration of its resolution, the events en route in a phrase are elabora-
tions of either the phrase's structural beginning or its cadence (as the case
may be), and so forth.

In these musical cases the event thatis elaborated is retained along with
the event(s) that elaborate it; the structural beginning and the cadence of
a phrase do not disappear or convert into something else in the course of
fleshing out the phrase as a whole. In language, by contrast, grammatical
categories are not retained in the tree structure from level to level, but
break down into other categories; a verb phrase may break down into a
verb plus a noun phrase, which in turn may break down into an article
plus a noun, and so on. A mere transference of linguistic trees into their
musical counterpart would be misguided from the start.*

With these considerations in mind, we will develop purely musical
trees, having nothing to do with linguistic trees except that both express
hierarchical structures with precision. There is nothing esoteric about
this—the organization of a corporate bureaucracy might best be rep-
resented by a tree diagram; it is just a notation.

Given two pitch-events x and y, if y is an elaboration of x (see figure
5.6a), then its “branch” attaches to the branch of x, which continues
upward (presumably to attach to the branch of another event of which it
in turn is an elaboration); the converse can be said if x is an elaboration
of y (5.6b). The first case (5.6a) is called a “right branch,” and signifies
the subordination of an event to a preceding event; the second case (5.6b)
is called a “left branch,” and signifies the subordination of an event to a
succeeding event. (Sometimes, for purposes of discussion, it is useful to
indicate simply that the branches of two events attach, without any con-
cern for which dominates the other. In such cases we just connect their
branches neutrally, as in 5.6c.)

In accordance with the Strong Reduction Hypothesis, these branching
structures must meet the well-formedness conditions of strict hierarchical
structure. Thus the trees must satisfy the requirements of nonoverlap-
ping, adjacency, and recursion, just as did the grouping and metrical
structures (see sections 2.1 and 2.2). We will illustrate with a sequence of
four arbitrary pitch-events (figure 5.7). The principle of nonoverlapping
prohibits the crossing of branches (5.7a, 5.7b). It also disallows the as-
signment of more than one branch to the same event (5.7c), since that
