8. Schenker's (1925, 1935) more complex solution for the first “evenr” is dis-
cussed briefly in section 7.3 and more extensively in section 10.4, Such refine-
ments may be disregarded at this stage of our presentation.

2. The conception of time-span reduction is not new with us, though a number of
refinements are totally our own. To our knowledge, the time-span approach to
reduction has been developed, in various ways and to varying degrees, by Barnett
(1972), Komar (1971), Lewin (1974), Schachter (1980), Westergaard (1975), and
Yeston (1976). Our particular inspiration, for which we are most grateful, was
Lewin's unpublished essay on Schubert's song “Morgengruss.”

10. Schachter 1976 (pp. 330—334) also draws attention to this characteristic
conflict in “groupings.”

1. Lewin 1974, Komar 1971, and Schachter 1980 are examples of a metrical
approach to time-span reduction. Schachter restrices his version of time-span re-
duction (called “durarional reduction”) to relatively short and regular examples
in order to avoid hypothetical constructions. None of these works addresses the
question of out-of-phase passages.

2. Schenker himself wavers on this issue. In Der freie Satz (figure 21; paragraph
90) he advocates the interrupted V, but many of his graphs (such as the one of
Bach's chorale “Ich bin's .. .” in Schenker 1932) prescribe the final V. Komar
(1971), in keeping with his “background” metrical theory, appears to favor any
salient V thar approximatrely bifurcates the passage in question (see the analysis in
the appendix of Komar 1971 of the slow movement of Beethoven's Pathétique
Sonata). Schachter (1976, pp. 290-298) argues eloquently against the necessary
association of structurally important events with roughly equal time-spans; yer he
concedes (1980, pp. 211—-214) that when a centrally located V is sufficiently
prolonged near the musical surface, it might serve as the structura| dominant. We
think this concession confuses surface salience with reducrional funcrion.

1. Even in recitative and similar metrically unstructured music, the sequence of
atrack points produces a minimal, possibly irregular, metrical level in terms of
which time-spans can be defined. However, such music often has a less highly
articulated hierarchy of time-spans than metrically more structured music.

2. Example 7.8 contains several examples of a notarional abbreviation we have
adopted. Where a particular beat determines both a regular and an augmented
time-span, only the reduction of the latter 1s given in the secondary notation. On
the other hand, the tree indicates the complete reduction. For example, the re-
duction of the first three sixteenths takes place in two steps: the A and the B are
reduced to B alone in the regular time-span marked 2w; then the G and the B are
reduced to G alone in the augmented rime-span marked x. The branching in the
tree reflects these two steps, bur the musical notarion shows only the ourcome of
the second step.

3. In the case of a melody accompanied by an Alberti bass, the bass undergoes
fusion while the melody undergoes ordinary reduction. Although the intuitions
are clear, we have not attempted to incorporate such situations into our theory,
for the same reasons we avoided contrapuntal grouping structures: a formalism
to represent independent structures for separate voices becomes much too0 cum-
bersome to work with.
