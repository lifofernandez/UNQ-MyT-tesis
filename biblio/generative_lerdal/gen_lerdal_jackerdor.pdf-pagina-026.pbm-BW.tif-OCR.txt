untypically complex passage: the beginning of Mozart's G Minor Sym-
phony. The metrical analysis of the first nine bars appears in 2.10.

The cues in the music from the 8th-note level to the 2-bar level unam-
biguously support the analysis given. For example, at the 2-bar level, the
introductory bar, the down-up pattern of the bass notes, the motivic
structure of the melody, and the harmonic rhythm all conspire to produce
strong beats at the beginnings of odd-numbered bars. (Chapter 4 will
develop this analysis in detail.) The case is quite otherwise at the next
larger level, the 4-bar level. Should the beats at this level be placed at the
beginnings of measures 1, 5, and9, or at those of measures 3 and 7? The
cues in the music conflict. The harmonic rhythm supports the first in-
terpretation, yet it seems inappropriate to hear the strongest beats in each
4-bar theme-group (measure 2-5, 6—9) as occurring at the very end of
those groups (the downbeats of measures 5 and 9). Rather, the opening
motive seems to drive toward strong beats at the beginnings of measures
3 and 7. We incline toward this second interpretation— this is the reason
for the dots in parentheses at measures 3 and 7 in 2.10. But the real point
is that this large level of metrical analysis is open to interpretation,
whereas smaller levels are not.

The problems of large-scale metrical analysis become more acute if we
consider 2.11, a simplified version of the first 23 bars of Mozart's G
Minor Symphony.

First, observe that since measures 21—23 are parallel to measures 2-4, it
is impossible even at the measure level to maintain a regular alternation
of strong and weak beats; the strong beats at odd-numbered bars must at
some point give way to strong beats at even-numbered bars. Let us inves-
tigate where this point might be.

In 2.11 we have indicated only two metrical levels, the measure level
and the 2-measure level. The analysis of the first eight bars duplicates the
analysis in 2.10, where the downbeats of the odd-numbered bars were
stronger than those of the even-numbered bars. Whatever the case may
be in measures 9-13, however, it is clear that the downbeats of measures
14 and 16 are strong in relation to the downbeat of measure 15. The
reasons for this are that the melody forms whatiis felt to be an appoggia-
tura on D in measure 14, which resolves to C in measure 15, and that
the harmonic rhythm moves decisively from measure 14 to measure 16.
Once this new pattern of strong beats on the downbeats of even-num-
bered bars has been established, it continues without serious complica-
tion to the restatement of the theme at measures 21 ff. Where in measures
9-13, then, has the metrical shift taken place?

Imbrie 1973 makes a useful distinction between “conservative” and
“radical” hearings of shifting metrical structures, In a conservative hear-
ing the listener seeks to retain the previous pattern as long as possible
