would be tantamount to saying that an event (x in 5.7c) is an elaboration
of two different events.5 The principle of adjacency means that events are
heard in the context of their surrounding events at any given level of
analysis, Hence, not only can branches not cross, but a sequence of events
at any level must be exhaustively analyzed. This prohibits such analyses
as 5,7d, in which y does not receive a branch. We emphasize here that
“adjacency” does not necessarily mean adjacency on the musical surface;
1, X, y, and z in 5.7 might well form a seguence at an underlying reduc-
tional level, and hence might be far apart on the musical surface. Finally,
the principle of recursion says that an indefinite number of events could
be analyzed by means of these branchings, forming an indefinite number
of reductional levels. This is what permits the Eroica as well as a Bach
chorale phrase to be reduced.

In contrast with 5,7a—5.7d, 5.7e—5.7h are well-formed trees. By way
of example, 5.7e can be read as follows: x is an elaboration of w, and y is
an elaboration of z; at the next larger level, z is an elaboration of w (thus
y is recursively an elaboration of 1).

As an illustration of the tree notation, example 5.8 repeats the reduc-
tion of “O Haupt” given in 5.4, this time with the tree added above. (Of
course, we have not yet stated the criteria that determine what branches
from what.) The correspondence between the tree and the musical nota-
tion should be clear: one can think of each musical level as representing a
horizontal slice across the tree, showing only the events whose branches
appear in that slice. The dashed lines across the tree in 5.8 illustrate this
correspondence.

One objection that might be raised against expressing reductions by
means of these trees is that it might be thought arbitrary to have to attach
a subordinate event—say, the neighboring chord in $.9—either to the
preceding event (5.9a) or to the ensuing event (5.9b).
