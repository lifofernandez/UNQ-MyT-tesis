GPR 3 (Change) (p. 46)

Consider a seguence of four notes nnon3n4. All else being equal, the

transition 7,—n; may be heard as a group boundary if

a. (Register) the transition 1,—n; involves a greater intervallic distance
than both 7,—n, and n;—n,, orif

b. (Dynamics) the transition 1,—n involves a change in dynamics and
11—n, and n3—n4 do not, orif

c. (Articulation) the transition n,—n3 involves a change in articulation
and 1,—n; and n3—n,4 do not, or ¡f

d. (Length) n, and n are of different lengths and both pairs 11,7 and
A3,14 do not differ in length.

GPR 4 (Intensification) (p. 49)
Where the effects picked out by GPRs 2 and 3 are relatively more pro-
nounced, a larger-level group boundary may be placed.

GPR 5 (Symmetry) (p. 49)
Prefer grouping analyses that most closely approach the ideal subdivision
of groups into two parts of equal length.

GPR 6 (Parallelism) (p. 51)
Where two or more segments of the music can be construed as parallel,
they preferably form parallel parts of groups.

GPR 7 (Time-Span and Prolongational Stability) (p. 52)
Prefer a grouping structure that results in more stable time-span and/or
prolongational reductions.

Grouping Overlap (p. 60)
Given a well-formed underlying grouping structure G as described by
GWFRs 1-5, containing two adjacent groups g¡ and gs such that

£1 ends with event e,

£2 begins with event e,, and

€1 = e,
a well-formed surface grouping structure G' may be formed that is iden-
tical to G except that

it contains one event e' where G had the sequence e,e,

e' = e = e»,

all groups ending with e, in G end with e' in G', and

all groups beginning with e, in G begin with e' in G'.

Grouping Elision (p. 61)
Given a well-formed underlying grouping structure G as described by
GWERs 1-5, containing two adjacent groups g¡ and gs such that

£1 ends with event e,
