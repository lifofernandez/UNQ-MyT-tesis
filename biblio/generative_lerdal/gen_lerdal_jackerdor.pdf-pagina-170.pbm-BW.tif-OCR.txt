The I presents a more stable melodic line, since it represents an unfold-
ing of the tonic chord. The influence of linear connection in both 7.20
and 7.21 can be stated as TSRPR 6a:

TSRPR 6a (Linear Stability, preliminary version) In choosing the head of
a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more stable linear connec-
tions with events in adjacent time-spans.

The analysis of “O Haupt” in 7.17 also made implicit use of a second
nonlocal influence. In the third quarter of the first measure there is a
choice between a IV on the first eighth and a V$ on the second. Since the
IVS is in strong metrical position and is intrinsically more consonant, the
principles discussed so far would seem to favor it. But compare the two
choices within the context of the reduction, in example 7.22. Example
7.22a has the IV* and 7.22b the V$, marked by asterisks.

7.22

 

Example 7.22b is intuitively preferable, despite the apparent predictions
of the rules mentioned above. What favors it? TSRPR 6a might select it
because of the stepwise motion of the bass from the third to the fourth
beat, and TSRPR 4 (parallelism) might pick out the parallelism between
this stepwise bass motion and that in the first halves of the first and
second measures (marked by braces in 7.22b). However, a further con-
sideration is the greater stability of the V$-I progression in 7.22b over
the IVé-L in 7.22a. This suggests TSRPR 6b:

TSRPR 6b (Harmonic Progression, preliminary version) In choosing the
head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more stable har-
monic connections with events in adjacent time-spans.

We have left unspecified in TSRPRs 6a and 6b what constitutes a rela-
tively stable linear or harmonic connection. To provide this information,
the relative stability of various connections could be stipulated directly
within the statement of the preference rules, But there is an alternative.
Looking ahead to chapters 8 and , two primary factors affect the choice
of prolongational reduction: time-span importance and stability of con-
nection among events. Now if the events that are important in time-span
reduction also form stable linear and harmonic connections, a highly
reinforced choice of prolongational reduction is possible. On the other
hand, if the time-span reduction does not follow the strongest possible
