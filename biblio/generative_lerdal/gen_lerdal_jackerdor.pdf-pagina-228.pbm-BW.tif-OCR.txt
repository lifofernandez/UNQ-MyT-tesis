PRPR 3 (Prolongational Connection) In choosing the prolongationally
most important event e, in a prolongational region (e;—e;), prefer an ex
that attaches so as to form a maximally stable prolongational connection
with one of the endpoints of the region.

In applying this form of PRPR 3 to 9.8 we find that the most stable
connection is of the intermediate I to the initial I, since this forms a right
prolongation; 9.9a is the resulting tree. In turn, the V is now between two
ls, so that PRPR 3 is indeterminate. Because of the grouping, however,
PRPR 2 applies to attach the V to the initíal I, as in 9.9b. The preference
rules have thus carried out the derivation discussed in detail in chapter 8
(examples 8.14—8.17).

Notice that the attachment of the intermediate T in 9.9a overrides PRPR 2,
which would prefer attachment to the following V.

Now we turn to refining the concept of stable prolongational connec-
tion. Most of the relevant factors were mentioned in sections 8.1 and 8.2;
we Will enumerate them here as a set of conditions to which PRPR 3
refers.

Stability Conditions for Prolongational Connection
1. (Branching condition)

a. Right strong prolongations are more stable than right weak prolon-
gations, which in turn are more stable than right progressions.

b. Left progressions are more stable than left weak prolongations,
Which in turn are more stable than left strong prolongations.

2. (Pitch-collection condition)
A connection between two events 1s more stable if they involve or
imply a common diatonic collection.

3. (Melodic condition)

a. (Distance) A connection between two events is melodically more sta-
ble ¡f the interval between them is smaller (with the exception of the
octave, Which is relatively stable).

b. (Direction) An ascending melodic progression is most stable as a
right-branching structure; a descending one is most stable as a left-
branching structure.
