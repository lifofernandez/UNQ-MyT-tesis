Vergnaud and Halle (1979) show that there are languages in which the
counterpart of rule 1a has the reverse effect, marking the second syllable
strong. Rule 1b could conceivably have a mirror-image counterpart,
making the foot weak; however, the empirical need for such a rule is as
yet unclear.

The next layer in the hierarchy is the aggregation of feet into words.
Liberman and Prince (1977) give the following rule for English:

Prominence Rule 2 (Lexical Category Prominence) In a segment im-
mediately containing two feet, the second is strong if and only if it
branches.*!

This rule results in the trees in 12.18 for gymnast, reconciliation, anec-
dote, and anecdotal. Notice in particular the contrast between the last
two of these, where the extra syllable -al causes the second foot of anec-
dotal to branch, in turn altering the tree and shifting stress to -do-.

A similar rule governs the aggregation of words into larger words:

Prominence Rule 3 (Compound Stress) In a word immediately contain-
ing two words, the second is strong i¡f and only if it branches into two
words.

This rule accounts for the contrast berween main stress on Rorschach in
Rorschach blot and on ink in Rorschach ink-blot. In the latter only, the
second word on the next-to-largest level of segmentation branches into
