nent; thus on grounds of learnability we would argue that the presence of
such a component in musical grammar represents a contribution of in-
nate musical capacity, even if some ofits particular rules must be learned.

A second kind of evidence for innateness appeals to the existence of
universals of musical grammar, in the sense defined in the preceding
section. Though it is possible to attribute grammatical universals to cul-
tural diffusion or to mere historical accident, another explanation is that
they reflect cognitive similarities among all human beings—innate as-
pects of mind that transcend particular cultures or historical periods.
Thus universals of musical grammar, especially those of the abstract sort
presented here, can be taken to represent innate aspects of musical cogni-
tion, and the differences among grammars can be taken to represent
learned aspects of musical idioms. (As suggested in the preceding section,
claims of universality are empirical, and are subject to verification or
falsification by historical and ethnomusicological research.)

The range of variation among rules in different idioms also constitutes
grounds for hypotheses about innateness. For example (to consider an
extreme case), though idioms differ in metrical and intervallic possibil-
ities, we feel safe in conjecturing that there is no idiom that makes use of
metrical regularities 31 beats apart, or for which the most stable melodic
interval is the thirteenth. Rather, given the number of conceivable op-
tions, the differences among idioms fall into a relatively constrained set.
These constraints on variation give an indication of the limitations of
human musical cognition—the possibilities for structuring the musical
surface available to someone learning an idiom.

As many readers will no doubt be skeptical of our claim that a great
deal of musical grammar is innately specified, let us see what it would
take to falsify the claim. Beside providing evidence from other idioms for
the nonuniversality of particular rules of musical grammar, one might
take issue with the argument in three other ways.

First, someone who grants the existence of a musical grammar in the
mind of the experienced listener might still deny that it is in part innate.
But it is not enough to deny innateness on the basis of methodological
preference; it is incumbent on such a critic to explain how all the com-
plexities of musical grammar might otherwise be learned.

Alternatively, one could simply deny the existence of as rich a musical
grammar as we have claimed, proposing instead a theory of musical
intuition with much simpler and hence (perhaps) more learnable princi-
ples. Such a criticism, however, calls for an explanation of all the musical
intuitions we have discussed in motivating our theory. In short, we be-
lieve it would be extremely difficult to overcome the argument for the
innateness of a substantial body of musical grammar, even f many of our
formulations of the rules should prove incorrect.

A third criticism, and one to which we would be more receptive, might
ask why evolution should have provided us with such complex innate
