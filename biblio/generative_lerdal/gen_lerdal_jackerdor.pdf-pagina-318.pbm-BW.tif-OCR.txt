conditions that establish preferred forms for rules of grammar but may
be violated by particular grammars. Principles of markedness have been
appealed to especially in phonology (see, for example, Trubetzkoy 1939;
Chomsky and Halle 1968), but syntactic theory has also often made use
of the characteristic marked-unmarked distinction. A more general form
of markedness conventions is the evaluation metric for grammars, pro-
posed by Chomsky (1965). The evaluation metric embodies a set of
preferences that enable the child to choose a grammar from among nu-
merous possibilities, where the choice is underdetermined by the linguis-
tic evidence available to the child. It is a fundamental component of
contemporary theories of generative grammar.

Finally, the theory of parsing strategies — part of the study of linguistic
performance—has frequently made use of heuristic strategies that make
a “best guess” about the structure of a sentence being processed (see
Kimball 1973; Wanner and Maratsos 1978; J. D. Fodor 1978). Again,
preference-rule-like behavior is clearly observable, in the way that syn-
tactic and semantic evidence interact to determine which of many poten-
tial structures is to be selected.

Thus, although the general notion of preference rules and the charac-
teristics of preference-rule systems have not been recognized as such
within linguistic theory, a number of linguistic phenomena do display the
requisite properties. In general, generative linguistics, perhaps because of
its historical roots in the theory of computability, has stressed only the
contribution of well-formedness rules. By contrast, much research on
vision has concentrated on the equivalent of preference rules. The theory
of musical cognition developed here highlights the necessity for both
types of rules, not only for music, but for language and vision as well.

This section will show that the formalism developed in chapters 5—7 to
express time-span reduction is a notational variant of a formalism in
linguistics called prosodic structure. After demonstrating the relationship
we will ask whether the relationship is an accident or whether it rests on a
principled basis. In an effort to answer this question we will compare the
theory of prosodic structure with the theory of time-span reduction. Our
conclusion will be that these theories are closely related in form, though
not in substance. The implications of this parallel for more gen-
eral issues of cognition are discussed in the last part of this section.

Prosodic Structure

The theory of phonology has traditionally assumed that the sound pat-
tern of language is determined simply in terms of the linear string of
phonological segments (or phonemes). However, under this assumption
(developed in greatest detail in Chomsky and Halle 1968) many phe-
nomena of stress placement, stress subordination, vowel harmony (in
