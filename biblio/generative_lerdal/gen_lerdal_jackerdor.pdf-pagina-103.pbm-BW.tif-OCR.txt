The point of our brief foray into other metrical idioms is that, in
developing a theory of tonal music that addresses the issues of musical
universals and acquisition of musical knowledge, one should construct
formalisms that are adequate to express the facts of other idioms, and one
should try to localize the similarities and differences between idioms in
the statements of particular rules. In the cases presented here, the differ-
ences lie in what corresponds in other idioms to MWERs 3 and 4. These
differences in rules represent what one must learn about an idiom to
become an experienced listener.

As mentioned in section 4.1, tonal music often has from one to three
levels of metrical structure that are larger than the level notated by bar
lines, corresponding to regularities of two, four, and even eight measures.
Except in the most banal music, these levels are commonly subject to a
certain degree of irregularity. The metrical well-formedness rules pro-
posed in section 4.1, however, require that a metrical level be unswerv-
ingly regular throughout a piece or at least a major section of a piece.
They are therefore incapable of allowing for irregularity in a metrical
level except by abandoning that level altogether—which amounts to
claiming that there is no regularity at all. This section will show how two
important kinds of larger-level metrical irregularity can be incorporated
into the theory. Both depend on the interaction of metrical structure and
grouping. The first involves irregular-length groups, the second grouping
overlap and elision.

As will be seen more clearly in the discussion of time-span reduction,
the segmentation of the musical surface forms a hierarchy whose levels
can be divided roughly into three zones. At the smallest levels, metrical
structure is responsible for most factors of segmentation; at the largest
levels, grouping structure bears all the weight of segmentation. In be-
tween lies a transitional zone in which grouping gradually takes over
responsibility from metrical structure, as units of organization become
larger and as metrical intuitions become more attenuated because of the
long time intervals between beats. It is in this zone of musical organiza-
tion that metrical irregularities appear in tonal music.

In this transitional zone one hears metrical structure, but parallelism
among groups of irregular length often forces metrical structures into
irregularity above the measure level. The openings of the Mozart C Ma-
jor Quintet K. 515 and the Chorale St. Antoni used in the Brahms
“Haydn” Variations (see section 8.5) are well-known cases of five-
measure phrases; examples of this sort are numerous. In order to make it
possible for these phrases to receive a metrical analysis, MWER 4 must
cease to enforce strict metrical regularity at more than two or three levels
above the tactus (usually the one- or two-measure levels). Nonetheless,
