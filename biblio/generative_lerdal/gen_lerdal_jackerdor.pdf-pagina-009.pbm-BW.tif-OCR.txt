The Connection
with Linguistics

formal criteria common to any theoretical enterprise, requiring internal
coherence and simplicity of the formal model relative to the complexity
of the phenomena it accounts for. In short, we conceive of our theory as
being in principle testable by usual scientific standards; that is, subject to
verification or falsification on various sorts of empirical grounds.*

In advocating these goals for inquiry about music, we are adopting a
stance analogous to that taken in the study of language by the school of
generative-transformational grammar, most widely known through the
work of Noam Chomsky (see for example Chomsky 1965, 1968, 1975).5
This approach has resulted in a depth of understanding about the nature
of language unparalleled in previous approaches. Inasmuch as it has
caused questions to be asked about language that could not even be
imagined before, it has also revealed the extent of our ignorance; this too
is progress.

Generative linguistic theory is an attempt to characterize what a
human being knows when he knows how to speak a language, enabling
him to understand and create an indefinitely large number of sentences,
most of which he has never heard before. This knowledge is not on the
whole available to conscious introspection and hence cannot have been
acquired by direct instruction. Linguistic theory models this unconscious
knowledge by a formal system of principles or rules called a grammar,
which describes (or “generates”) the possible sentences of the language.

Because many people have thought of using generative linguistics as a
model for music theory, it is worth pointing out what we take to be the
significant parallel: the combination of psychological concerns and the
formal nature of the theory. Formalism alone is to us uninteresting except
insofar as it serves to express musically or psychologically interesting
generalizations and to make empirical issues more precise. We have de-
signed our formalism with these goals in mind, avoiding unwarranted
overformalization.$

Many previous applications of linguistic methodology to music have
foundered because they attempt a literal translation of some aspect of
linguistic theory into musical terms— for instance, by looking for musical
“parts of speech,” deep structures, transformations, or semantics. But
pointing out superficial analogies berween music and language, with or
without the help of generative grammar, is an old and largely futile game.
One should not approach music with any preconceptions that the sub-
stance of music theory will look at all like linguistic theory. For example,
whatever music may “mean,” it is in no sense comparable to linguistic
meaning; there are no musical phenomena comparable to sense and ref-
erence in language, or to such semantic judgments as synonymy, analytic-
ity, and entailment. Likewise there are no substantive parallels berween
elements of musical structure and such syntactic categories as noun, verb,
