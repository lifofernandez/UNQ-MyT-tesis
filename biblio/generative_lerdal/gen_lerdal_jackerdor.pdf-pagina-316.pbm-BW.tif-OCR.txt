Example 12.7a asserts category membership of an individual designated
nonverbally; 12.7b asserts the category membership of an individual
designated verbally; 12.7c asserts the inclusion of one category in an-
'other. Judgments of type 12.7b and 12.7c are basic to most theories of
entailment, analyticity, and so forth. Jackendoff (forthcoming) gives evi-
dence that all three sentence types present essentially the same problems
to a theory of word meaning.

Most theories of word meaning treat categorization as an open-and-
shut case. But this is an oversimplification. Many judgments are uncer-
tain— for example, those in 12.8a—12.8c, which correspond to sentence
types 12.7a—12.7c, respectively. Connoisseurs of linguistic semantics will
notice that appealing to insufficient scientific knowledge, fuzzy logic (see
Lakoff 1972), or division of linguistic labor (Putnam 1975) will not help
account for the uncertainty in these examples.

An adequate theory of word meaning must allow for such uncertain
judgments.

A related problem is pointed out in Wittgenstein 1953. In his well-
known discussion of the word game, Wittgenstein shows that there can-
not be necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a game,
since there are no properties shared by all games that are not also shared
by other activities that are not games. Similar arguments can be applied
to most words in the language: for almost any condition one can place on
the members of a category, there are individuals that are exceptions to
the condition but are still intuitively judged to be members of the cate-
gory. Thus necessary and sufficient conditions are generally too strong a
requirement on a theory of word meaning. Wittgenstein argues that word
meanings should be characterized in terms of a system of overlapping
“family resemblances” —characteristics that members of a category may,
but need not, share. This suggestion has been investigated experimentally
in the work of Eleanor Rosch (see particularly Rosch and Mervis 1975).
These results suport the family-resemblance hypothesis, showing in addi-
tion that the members of categories that are considered most prototypical
of that category are those with the most attributes in common with other
members of the category and the fewest attributes in common with mem-
bers of other categories.

These arguments suggest that the proper formalization of word mean-
ings is as a combination of well-formedness rules and preference rules,
