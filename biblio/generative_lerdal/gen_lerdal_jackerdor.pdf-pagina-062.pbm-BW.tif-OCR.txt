in tonal music, especially in “developmental” pieces such as sonata-form
movements, where they have a great deal to do with the sense of con-
tinuity: overlaps at major group boundaries prevent the piece from
reaching a point of rhythmic completion.

In addition to true overlap, in which an event or sequence of events is
shared by two adjoining groups, there is another overlap situation more
accurately described as elision. Consider the opening of the allegro of the
first movement of Haydn's Symphony no. 104 (example 3.26).

The groups ending in measure 16 are interrupted by the new fortissimo
group. One's sense is not that the downbeat of measure 16 is shared, as ¡f
the group ending in measure 16 were heard as 3.27a; a more accurate
description of the intuition is that the last event of 3.27b is elided by the
fortissimo.

 

A second and somewhat rarer type of elision occurs when a group
ending forte obscures the beginning of a group starting piano, as in the
ending of the first movement of Schubert's “Unfinished” Symphony (ex-
ample 3.28).

 

The pianissimo group is not heard as beginning with a fortissimo chord,
but as beginning with an unheard pianissimo attack. We will refer to the
two kinds of elisions exemplified in 3.26 and 3.28 as left elision and right
elision respectively: part of the left group is elided in the former and part
of the right group in the latter.

In thinking about grouping overlaps, it is useful again to invoke a
visual parallel. Consider 3.29a. It is most likely perceived as two abutting
