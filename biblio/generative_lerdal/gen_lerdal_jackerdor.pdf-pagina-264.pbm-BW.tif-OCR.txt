are mutually reinforcing. (Obviously, the prolongational tree could be
carried out in more detail.)

Turning now to the Bach C Major Prelude, represented at the measure
level in 10.10, we find that the uniform surface of the music yields an
unusual paucity of evidence for the grouping and metrical analyses—and
hence for time-span segmentation. But this does not mean that grouping
and metrical issues of interest do not arise. Consider first the hypermetri-
cal structure. The piece seems to begin in a hypermetrical 4/4, and clearly
proceeds from measure 24 (the dominant arrival) to the end in the same
fashion. Thus there must be either a “missing” measure or a hypermetri-
cal adjustment between the beginning and measure 24. In the nineteenth
century an added measure was widely accepted between measures 22 and
23 (a.i5), presumably to rectify the irregularity in metrical periodicity (as
well as to eliminate the diminished third in the bass line). Alternatively,
one might hear hypermetrical 4/4 bars until measure 21, then a hyper-
metrical 3/4 until measure 24. At the opposite extreme, Schenker 1932
readjusts the hypermetrical 4/4 already at measure 4, because of the
