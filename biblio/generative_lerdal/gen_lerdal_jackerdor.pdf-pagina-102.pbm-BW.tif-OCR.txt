Claude le Jeune's metrical experiment apparently did not form the
basis of any larger tradition. However, another complex metrical tradi-
tion, studied extensively in Singer 1974, is found in a large body of folk
music from Macedonia and Bulgaria. Though this music has metrical
regularity at the sixteenth-note and measure levels, the level of metrical
structure with which dance steps are most closely correlated (the tactus)
is irregular, consisting of units which Singer classifies as slow (S) and
quick (Q); the S units are one and a half times the length of the Q units.
Meter in this music is most easily represented as a repeating pattern of
slows and quicks; for example, OOS (2+2+3). Singer quotes the dance
tune “Racenitsa,” reproduced in part in 4.45, as a typical example of the

O0S meter.

4.45

 

Singer points out that not all possible combinations of Ss and Os are
possible meters in this metrical idiom; QOSS (2+3+3), for example,
never appears. The meters that actually occur group into a number of
families; Singer states well-formedness rules that express the generaliza-
tions among these possible meters. Within the present theory, the Mace-
donian metrical idiom would be described in part by replacing MWFR 4
with Singer's rules. We will not take the space here to discuss the rules,
but Singer's list of basic meters in example 4.46 gives some idea of the
complexity involved. This example omits compound meters, which com-
plicate the situation further.
