TSRWER 3 If T contains other time-spans, let T;,..., 7, be the (regular or
augmented) time-spans immediately contained in T and let e,,...,e, be
their respective heads. Then:

a. (Ordinary Reduction) The head of T may be one of the events
€ y-- .E a-

b. (Fusion) If e,,...,€, are not separated by a group boundary (“locality”

condition), the head of T may be the superimposition of two or more

Of e1,...,en.

(Transformation) If e,,...,e, are not separated by a group boundary,

the head of T may be some mutually consonant combination of pitches

chosen out of e,,...,én-

d. (Cadential Retention) The head of T may be a cadence whose final is
e, (the head of 7;,, the last time-span immediately contained in T) and
whose penult, if there is one, is the head of a time-span immediately
preceding T, though not necessarily at the same level.

TSRWER 4 Ifa two-element cadence is directly subordinate to the head
e of a time-span T, the final is directly subordinaté to e and the penult is
directly subordinate to the final.

The two segmentation rules plus TSRWFRs 1-4 are now sufficiently
rich to express the class of time-span reductions that we have motivated.
However, as was the case with the grouping and metrical components,
the definition of a set of possible structures is insufficient. How is the
theory to choose the head of á time-span from among the heads of
the immediately contained time-spans? This question is addressed by the
time-span reduction preference rules.

The principles for selecting the head of a time-span fall into three catego-
ries. Local rules attend exclusively to the rhythmic structure and pitch
content of the events within the time-span itself. Nonlocal rules bring
into play the pitch content of other time-spans (essentially considerations
of voice-leading and parallelism). Structural accent rules involve articu-
lation of group boundaries. This section deals with the first two types;
section 7.4 discusses the third.

An initial caveat: We will not specify what factors motivate the choice
of fusion or transformation rather than ordinary reduction in a time-
span. Nonetheless, we will not hesitate to use fusion and transformation
in our analyses where they are intuitively appropriate.

Consider the reduction of example 7.16a at the quarter-note level.
