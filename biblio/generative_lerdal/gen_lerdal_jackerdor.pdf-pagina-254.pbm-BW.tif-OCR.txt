Some Analyses

In this chapter we present a variety of suggestive analyses generated by
the theory. For reasons of space we will not attempt to derive these
analyses in any detail, but will confine our remarks to points of special
interest, It will be understood that, within a limited range, alternate
“preferred” analyses might also be predicted by the rules.

Usually the periodicity of metrical structure—whether it is in or out of
phase with grouping structure— proceeds in a regular correspondence
with grouping structure, so that parallel passages receive parallel metrical
analyses (metrical preference rule 1). When groups become irregular in
length, either a large-scale metrical adjustment of some kind occurs or
large-scale metrical levels simply fail to apply. But Schubert, in the
A Major Waltz from his Valses Sentimentales, op. 50 (example 10.1),
accomplishes the feat of maintaining hypermetrical beats four bars apart
throughout, within the irregular grouping context of an AA'BA” form
composed of 10+8+10+10 bars; this is illustrated schematically in
10.2.

In the grouping analysis shown in 10.1 and 10.2, the A and A' sec-
tions are straightforward: the theme twice forms symmetrical units of
2+2+2+2 bars, at the next level 4+4 bars, then 8 bars. However, the
two introductory bars of tonic harmony turn the A section finally into a
10-bar group; the A' section works as an 8-bar group because the equiv-
alent tonic harmony has already been supplied by the final chord of the A
section. In the B section, one at first tends—out of a “conservative”
hearing of group structure —to hear the grouping as 2 +2=4 bars, and so
on, parallel to the patterns previously established (the dashed grouping
slur in 10.1). But measures 21-24 are repeated exactly in measures
25—28, forming parallel groups (grouping preference rule 6); conse-
quently, a “radical” hearing attaches the crucial 2-bar group in measures
