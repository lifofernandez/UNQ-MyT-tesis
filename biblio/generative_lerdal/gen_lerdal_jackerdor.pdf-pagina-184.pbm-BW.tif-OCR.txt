way. Let us survey some elementary examples to motivate our general
approach.

A single pitch (say, the tonic note C) produces no particular tension. A
repetition of this pitch may create rhythmic tension, but no real melodic
tension; the C is merely prolonged. However, the insertion of another
pitch between the two Cs creates a tensing, then a relaxing, of melodic
progression, as illustrated by the neighboring motion in 8.1 (£ and r stand
for tensing and relaxing). This effect is due to the comparative dissonance
of the D within its context.

8.1

Next consider the motion from E to C in 8.2a. Because the second
event is more “consonant,” the progression is felt as a relaxation. We can
then elaborate 8.2a by the insertion of a passing tone between the E and
the C (8.2b), thereby superimposing a second, more local, pattern of
tension and relaxation like that in 8.1.

 

Adding a bass line converts the dissonant passing tone in 8.2b into a
root-position (implied) triad, yielding the quasi-Ursatz in 8.2c. The over-
all pattern of tension and relaxation, however, does not change berween
8.2b and 8.2c; musical particulars can vary within a specific pattern of
tensing and relaxing.

In 8.3 we elaborate 8.2b further, by inserting a D and an E in the
middle.

 

Here the contrasting durational values produce different prolongational
perceptions: in 8.3a the first D is heard as a lower neighbor within the
context of a prolonged E; in 8.3b the second E is heard as an upper
