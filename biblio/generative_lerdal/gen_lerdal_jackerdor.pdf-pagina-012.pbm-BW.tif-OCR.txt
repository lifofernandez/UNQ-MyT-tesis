The Overall Form
of the Theory

importance depends on more elementary intuitions concerning the seg-
mentation and rhythmic analysis of the musical surface; thus we offer a
firmer foundation for the study of artistic questions. We consider our
work to complement rather than compete with such study.

Our interest in the musically mundane does not deter us from taking
masterpieces of tonal music as the analytic focus for our inquiry. As will
be seen, it is often easiest to motivate principles of the theory with in-
vented examples that are, roughly, “musical prose.” But there are two
reasons for then going on to grapple with existing works of art, one
preferential and the other methodological. First, it is less rewarding to
specify structural descriptions for normative but dull examples than for
works of lasting interest. Second, if we were to restrict ourselves.to
contrived examples, there would always be the danger, through excessive
limitation of the possibilities in the interest of conceptual manageability,
of oversimplifying and thereby establishing shallow or incorrect princi-
ples with respect to music in general. Tonal masterpieces provide a rich
data sample in which the possibilities of the idiom are revealed fully.8

An artistic concern that we do not address here is the problem of
musical affect—the interplay berween music and emotional responses.
By treating music theory as primarily a psychological rather than a purely
analytical enterprise, we at least place it in a territory where questions of
affect may meaningfully be posed. But, like most contemporary music
theorists, we have shied away from affect, for it is hard to say anything
systematic beyond crude statements such as observing that loud and fast
music tends to be exciting. To approach any of the subtleties of musical
affect, we assume, requires a better understanding of musical structure.?
In restricting ourselves to structural considerations, we do not mean to
deny the importance of affect in one's experience of music. Rather we
hope to provide a steppingstone toward a more interesting account of
affect than can at present be envisioned.

A comprehensive theory of music would account for the totality of the
listener's musical intuitions. Such a goal is obviously premature. In the
present study we will for the most part restrict ourselves to those compo-
nents of musical intuition that are hierarchical in nature. We propose
four such components, all of which enter into the structural description
of a piece. As an initial overview we may say that grouping structure
expresses a hierarchical segmentation of the piece into motives, phrases,
and sections. Metrical structure expresses the intuition that the events of
the piece are related to a regular alternation of strong and weak beats at a
number of hierarchical levels. Time-span reduction assigns to the pitches
of the piece a hierarchy of “structural importance” with respect to their
position in grouping and metrical structure. Prolongational reduction
