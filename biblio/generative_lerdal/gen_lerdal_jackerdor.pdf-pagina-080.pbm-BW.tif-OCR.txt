MPR 2 (Strong Beat Early) Weakly prefer a metrical structure in which
the strongest beat in a group appears relatively early in the group.

A place in real music where the effect of MPR 2 is evident is 4,13, the
beginning of the coda of Beethoven's Leonore Overture no. 3 (measures
514-525).

At this point there is a new tempo, so there is no previous metrical
evidence to guide the listener. One tends to hear strong beats at each
upward leap — despite the fact that at the seventh group, marked here
with an asterisk, the regularity begins to come at the unmetrical distance
of seven notes.

Inception of Events and Local Stress

A further and more obvious source of metrical differentiation is the
distinction berween beats occupied by the inception of pitch-events and
those occupied by rests or continuations of pitch-events, In 4.14, for
instance, strong beats at the eighth-note level occur much more naturally
at the attack points of notes than between them: metrical structure i is
preferred over metrical structure ¿i. (Structure íí is intuitively somewhat
less unstable in 4,14a than in 4.14b, This difference will be accounted for
below.)

The preference for structure ¿ over structure ¿i is expressed in MPR 3,

MPR 3 (Event) Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L; that
coincide with the inception of pitch-events are strong beats of L;.

It often happens that the attack pattern of a given musical surface is
such that there is no way to satisfy MPR 3 fully. Example 4.15 is one such
case. (Applications of MPR 3 are marked.)
