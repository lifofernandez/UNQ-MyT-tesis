Preliminary
Construction of
Reductions

linear-motivic aspects of pitch structure cannot be given proper system-
atic treatment without a theory of the hierarchical structures within
which they are heard, we feel justified for now in concentrating on the
hierarchical aspects.

This emphasis denies neither the importance of the linear-motivic as-
pects nor their influence on the hierarchical dimensions. Their influence is
dealt with in the preference rules for reductions; that is, the linear-
motivic is not part of reductions per se, but an input to reductions.
Moreover, specific levels of reduction provide further material for
linear-motivic analysis (see section 10.2 for examples). Thus the purely
reductional approach, though one-sided, is not so one-sided as one might
at first suppose. (Ultimately, one would also want an independent formal
component for assigning linear-motivic structure. See the general discus-
sion in section 11.4.)

A final possible objection to the trees is not substantive but practical:
they are too hard to read. In response, we can only say that their difficulty
lies solely in their novelty. If we had been able to invent an equally
efficient and accurate representation through traditional musical nota-
tion, we would have done so, As it is, we will often supply a secondary
and more traditional musical notation as an aid to reading the tree, as we
did in 5.8 above.

Now we are ready to explore what is needed to construct a reduction.
First we will attempt a reduction based only on pitch criteria. The need
for rhythmic criteria will lead us to the conception of time-span reduc-
tion. This will prove to be only partly successful, so we will then develop
the conception of prolongational reduction. All of this will be a mere
sketch in preparation for the extensive discussions in chapters 6—9.

In what follows, we can take as given the classical Western tonal pitch
system— the major-minor scale system, the traditional classifications of
consonance and dissonance, the triadic harmonic system with its roots
and inversions, the circle-of-fifths system, and the principles of good
voice-leading. Though all of these principles could and should be for-
malized, they are largely idiom-specific, and are well understood infor-
mally within the traditional disciplines of harmony and counterpoint.
Nothing will be lost if we conveniently consider them to be an input to
the theory of reductions.

What is needed, in addition, is a scale of stability among pitch configu-
rations, derived from the raw material of the given tonal system. Broadly,
the relative stability of a pitch-event can be thought of in terms of its
relative consonance or dissonance. For example, a local consonance is
more stable than a local dissonance, a triad in root position is more stable
than its inversions, the tonic is the most stable harmony, the relative
stability of two chords is a factor of the relative closeness to the tonic (or
