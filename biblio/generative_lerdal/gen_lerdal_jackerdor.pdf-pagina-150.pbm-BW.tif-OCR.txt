Formalization of Time-Span Reduction

In formalizing the time-span reduction, we begin by defining the time-
span structure—the segmentation of a piece into rhythmic units within
which relative structural importance of pitch-events can be determined.
Then, as in previous chapters, we take up in turn well-formedness rules
and preference rules.

We begin by defining the term time-span in terms of metrical structure:

A time-span is an interval of time beginning at a beat of the metrical
structure and extending up to, but not including, another beat.

This is the minimal condition on time-spans.! It must be developed fur-
ther in order to establish the time-span segmentation of a piece.

Section 6.1 discussed the intuitions behind time-span segmentation. Át
relatively large levels, we argued that the group is the unit of segmenta-
tion:

Segmentation Rule 1 Every group in a piece is a time-span in the time-
span segmentation of the piece.

Because, for purposes of deriving a time-span reduction, a piece must
be exhaustively segmented into time-spans at every level, it is neces-
sary to guarantee that no such grouping structure as 7.1 arises. The
gaps between groups would constitute domains not subject to time-span
reduction.
