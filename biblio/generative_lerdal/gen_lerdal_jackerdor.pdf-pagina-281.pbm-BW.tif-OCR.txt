whether they should derive directly from time-span reduction (which, in
any case, will remain with a single-tree analysis, by virtue of the time-
span segmentation). It would certainly make for a simpler theory if the
latter possibility obtained.

At issue, ultimately, is the perceptual status, in terms of tension and
relaxation, of music viewed as a sequence of discrete events. Insofar as
music is indeed heard this way, the prolongational component as devel-
oped in chapters 8 and 9 would seem to stand up fairly well. Yet a special
aspect of tonal musicis that the principles of harmonic (bass) motion and
of melodic motion, though interactive, are distinct. A single-tree analysis
must compromise these distinctions. The notion of a double-tree analysis
offers the possibility for expressing in a rule-governed way both the
interactive and the distinctive aspects of melodic and harmonic prolon-
gational relationships.
