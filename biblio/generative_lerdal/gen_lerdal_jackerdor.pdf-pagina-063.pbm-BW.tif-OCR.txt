hexagons that share a vertical side; in other words, it is resolved percep-
tually as 3.29b rather than as 3.29c or 3.29d.

A single boundary element functions as part of two independent figures.
This is comparable to overlap in music.
For a parallel to elision, consider 3.30a, which is most likely to be

resolved perceptually into a square partially obscured by a triangle
(3.30b), not as any of the other configurations shown.

b c d
The unlikely reading 3.30d is the closest visual parallel to the musical
example 3.27a. In both cases the left boundary of the right figure has
been used as the right boundary of the left figure, with inappropriate
results, The more natural interpretation in both cases is to infer a hidden
boundary.

These visual examples appear not to be just trivial analogs to the
musical phenomena. As in the discussion of preference rules, the possi-
bility of drawing parallels between auditory and visual domains points to
the operation of fundamental processes of perception and/or cognition.
In both cases of overlap a single element of the field presented to percep-
tion is perceived as belonging simultaneously to two adjacent figures,
neither of which is part of the other. In both cases of elision a boundary
element of one figure obscures an inferred boundary of an adjacent
figure. In the visual case the figures are perceived in space; in the musical

case they are perceived in time. But the perceptual effect is the same. (For
further discussion, see section 12.1.)

The Formal Representation of Overlaps and Elisions

Because the musical intuitions encountered in grouping overlaps and
elisions correspond to grouping structures that violate GWER 4, the
grouping well-formedness rules must be modified in order to be empiri-
cally correct. However, the appropriate alteration is not to abandon
GWER 4 totally, for such an alteration predicts the existence of grouping
structures such as 3.31, which do not occur.
