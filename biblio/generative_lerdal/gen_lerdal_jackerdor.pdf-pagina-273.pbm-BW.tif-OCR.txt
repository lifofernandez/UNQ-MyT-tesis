The actual prolongational structure of the song embodies an unexpected
deviation from his hopes.

It 1s an open question how well a formal music theory can incorporate
partially extramusical areas such as “dramatic” expectations, fulfill-
ments, and disappointments. Although our theory does not directly ad-
dress these concerns, we hope that it can be useful as a tool for discussing
them precisely.

To conclude this section, we will attempt a prolongational reduction of
the development of the first movement of Mozart's D Major Quintet, K.
593. First consider the prolongational reduction of the phrase that both
opens and closes the allegro (10.15). The dashed lines at the top of the
tree indicate the prolongational alternatives for the head of the phrase,
depending on its position in the time-span reduction (PRPR 1), which in
turn follows from the grouping. The chief reason this phrase can end as
well as begin the allegro is that it amply fulfills the tensing-relaxing
pattern of normative structure; it provides the prolongational criterion
for closure. As will be seen, the development section functions as an
enlargement of this phrase.

Figure 10.16 repeats the schematic prolongational tree for sonata form
developed in section 9.7. We are concerned here with the prolongational
region bracketed (x) —from the tonicized V at the end of the exposition
to the lat the beginning of the recapitulation. As discussed in section 9.7,
the V at the end of the development might attach either as a prolongation
of the V at the end of the exposition or as a progression to the beginning
the recapitulation (see the dashed branch attaching at either a or b in
10.16).

Now turn to 10.17, an already highly reduced version of the develop-
ment section of K. 593. The circled Roman numerals at the far left and
right signify the opening tonic and the final cadence, respectively; the
dashed line slicing across the upper region of the tree isolates the global
normative structure of the entire movement. The region bracketed (x)
beneath the music and the branching attachments marked a and b corre-
spond to the identical labelings in 10.16. As the tree in 10.17 indicates,
we have selected attachment a for the structural V at the end of the
development (measure 138), because it is locally tonicized and hence
forms a strong prolongation (PRPR 3) with the structural V at the end of
the exposition (measure 89). (However, this local tonicization is under-
mined by the previous descending-fifths sequence having progressed all
the way to the subdominant (measure 133); so attachment b is also
plausible.)

Thus both the opening phrase (10.15) and the development (10.17) are
contained within prolongations. But the analogy goes much farther than
this. In motivic and grouping structure, the development forms two parts
(measures 106-122 and 123-144) corresponding exactlv to the two
parts of the opening phrase (measures 1-4 and 5—8 in 10.15). (Measures
