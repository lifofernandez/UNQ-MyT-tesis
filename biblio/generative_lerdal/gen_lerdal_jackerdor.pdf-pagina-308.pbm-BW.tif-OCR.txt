account of perception was formulated by Wertheimer as the Law of
Prignanz. In Koffka 1935 (p. 110) it is stated briefly:

Psychological organization will always be as “good” as the prevailing conditions
allow. In this definition the term “good” is undefined. It embraces such properties
as regularity, symmetry, [and] simplicity.

In other words, the various principles of visual perception that Koffka
demonstrates are explications of the notion of “good” organization.

The preference rule component of the generative theory of musical
grouping resembles Wertheimer's and Koffka's account of vision in more
than the way individual rules apply and interact with each other. It also
has overall properties that make it a Gestalt theory in the sense just
described. First, it is mentalistic: it claims that perceived grouping is not
present in any direct way in the musical surface. In fact, the events of
grouping structure are not even in one-to-one correspondence with the
musical surface, since in grouping overlap one surface event appears
twice in underlying grouping structure, and in grouping elision an event
appears in grouping structure that is absent from the musical surface.
These noncorrespondences are made possible by claiming that grouping
structure is a mental construct, associated with the musical surface by
unconscious rules.

But the theory of grouping is not just mentalistic. It is specifically
Gestalt, in that it claims that grouping structures cannot be built up
strictly from their parts. Three of the preference rules are indeed con-
cerned with local details, and the information they provide is of undeni-
able importance. But the rule of intensification (grouping preference rule
4) involves comparison of scattered potential group boundaries, the rule
of symmetry (GPR 5) involves the total internal structure of groups, and
the rule of parallelism (GPR 6) can invoke the mutual influence of regions
spaced arbitrarily far apart. Furthermore, there are cases—such as the
opening theme of Mozart's G Minor Symphony, at transition 8—9 (ex-
ample 3.19)—in which the interpretation of a low-level local detail is
overridden by considerations of parallelism.

Other components of the musical grammar show even more clearly
that global considerations are essential for musical perception. For exam-
ple, in syncopation, preference rules for local metrical detail are over-
ridden by global requirements on metrical well-formedness. A choice of
head for a time-span is often influenced by a cadential function at some
larger level. Global considerations pervade prolongational reduction as a
result of its “top-down” construction.

The overall function of the preference rules is to select a structure that
is maximally stable; that is, they define what assignments of structure to a
musical surface are perceptually “good.” Thus the preference rules in
effect constitute an explicit statement of the Law of Prágnanz as it ap-
plies to musical perception.
