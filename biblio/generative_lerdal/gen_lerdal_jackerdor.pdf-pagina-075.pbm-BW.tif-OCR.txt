This overexplicitness becomes a descriptive liability in dealing with the
not uncommon passages in tonal music that mix incommensurate sub-
divisions of the beat, such as example 4.5 (from the Brahms Clarinet
Sonata op. 120, no. 2, measures 9-11).

 

 

 

 

 

 

As stated above, MWER 1 requires that each attack point in this passage
be associated with a beat on the smallest level. MWER 4 requires that this
smallest level of beats must be equally spaced. Thus the smallest beat
level must be spaced at the least common denominator of all the different
subdivisions—in this case 1/60 of the quarter note, an absurdly small
time interval.

These mechanical difficulties in the formal notation reflect a more basic
metrical intuition that the rules as stated fail to express. The metrical
structures described by MWERs 1-4 treat each metrical level, from small-
est to largest, as though it is as salient as every other. Yet metrical in-
tuitions about music clearly include at least one specially designated
metrical level, which we are calling the tactus. This is the level of beats
that is conducted and with which one most naturally coordinates foot-
tapping and dance steps. When one wonders whether to “feel” a piece
“in 4” or “in 2,” the issue is which metrical level is the tactus. In short,
the tactus is a perceptually prominent level of metrical structure that the
rules so far fail to designate as in any way special.

We can incorporate this notion into the formal theory by designating a
particular level in a metrical structure as the tactus. The tactus is required
to be continuous throughout the piece, but levels smaller than the tactus
are permitted to drop out when unnecessary. Normally, two or three
metrical levels larger than the tactus are continuous as well, extending to
whatis usually notated as the measure level; regular metrical units of two
and four measures are not uncommon. Example 4.6 illustrates the con-
ception of metrical structure that arises from incorporating this notion of
tactus. The tactus is either the eighth-note or the dotted quarter-note
level; the sixteenth-note level appears only where an eighth-note level
beat is subdivided in the surface.
