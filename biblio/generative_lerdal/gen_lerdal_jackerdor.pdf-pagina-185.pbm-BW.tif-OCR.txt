neighbor within the context of a prolonged D. It is apparent that rhyth-
mic as well as pitch factors affect intuitions about tension and relaxation.

This brief survey has shown the possibility of speaking of intuitions
about tension and relaxation in terms of superimposing simple patterns
in a hierarchical fashion to produce more complex patterns. But the nota-
tion of these patterns in 8.3 is already unwieldy. Before considering
longer examples, we must develop an adequate notation.

We begin by defining tension and relaxation in terms of right and left
prolongational branching. As diagrammed in 8.4, a tensing motion will
be represented by a right branch, a relaxing motion by a left branch.
These are structural interpretations placed on the elaborational hierar-
chies of prolongational trees. Henceforth we can dispense with the arrow
notation.

For both right and left branching we distinguish three possible kinds of
connection between two events. First, a simple joining of branches (8.5a)
signifies what we call a progression. This occurs when the harmonic roots
of the two events are different. (If a single line is analyzed, branch-
ing is decided largely on the basis of the implied harmony. Even the
simplest tunes in Western tonal music involve harmonic implications.)
