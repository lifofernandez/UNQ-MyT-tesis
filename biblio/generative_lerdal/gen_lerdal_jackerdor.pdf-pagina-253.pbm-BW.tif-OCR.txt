almost all of the preference rules have been justified on the basis of
readily audible characteristics of straightforward examples. The com-
plexity of tonal music arises from the interaction of these individually
fairly simple principles; in particular, many of the possibilities for musi-
cal interest arise from conflicts among competing principles. Thus we
have tried to show as completely as possible that each part of this com-
plex whole is grounded in what the listener hears.

Second, anyone who has thought about musical structure in any depth
ought to expect it to be this complex. One constantly reads statements
such as “. .. the interpretation of music—and this is what analysis
should be—is an art requiring experience, understanding, and sensitiv-
ity” (Cooper and Meyer 1960, p. 9). One is inclined to call an artifact
or activity arf when one cannot consciously decompose or reproduce
one's intuitions about it, and when one at the same time senses that these
intuitions are complex and subtle. 1f the principles underlying musical
intuition were simple and easily discovered, the sense of music as an art
would hardly be so strong. Indeed, the complexity of the grammar pre-
sented here is still only part of the story. We have explicitly left open
some important aspects of musical structure, and have not even begun to
approach the problem of musical affect, so crucial to artistic concerns.

A third justification for the complexity of the grammaris its status as a
theory of musical cognition—what the experienced listener knows that
enables him to comprehend music (and, for that matter, what an experi-
enced performer knows that enables him to make music comprehensi-
ble). Many people find it hard to believe that mental operations could be
so elaborate, especially since the structures they manipulate are so far
removed from the musical surface. However, we find no difficulty in
accepting a grammar of this complexity as a model of human knowledge.
In the only other areas of human cognitive function where we are aware
of theories whose scope is comparable to the present theory of music,
namely visual perception and language, the principles governing mental
function have been shown to be of commensurate complexity, In both of
these areas one is, ¡f anything, even less consciously aware of the com-
plexity of one's intuitions than in music. Unconscious processes of
amazing complexity and subtlety are by no means incompatible with a
conscious impression of great ease and fluidity, and with the sense that
one learns these cognitive tasks by “just picking them up” from experi-
ence with sufficient environmental stimulation. Our theory of music is no
different from these other areas in this respect. We would have been
surprised ¡f it had proved fundamentally simpler,.
