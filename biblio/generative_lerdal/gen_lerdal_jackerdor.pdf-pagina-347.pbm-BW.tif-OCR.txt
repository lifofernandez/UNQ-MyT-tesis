transformarions change meaning. This is, however, an evasion; see Jackendoff
1972, chapter $.

3. The material in this subsection 1s treated in greater depth in Jackendoff
(forthcoming).

4. See for example Kiparsky 1977, 1979; Selkirk 1978, 1980; Vergnaud and
Halle 1979; and the papers in Safir 1979.

5. One difference, however, is thar the prosodic trees permit only one weak
branch per node, whereas the musical trees sometimes permit more than one
elaboration per node. We return to this difference later in this section; ¡t is
immarerial to the discussion here.

6. There are numerous exceptions to this principle, as shown by contrasts in
English like or-che-stra versus or-ches-tral. A complete account of rules of syl-
labification is as vet unavailable.

7. The strucrtures in 12.14 are derived from the structure given in Selkirk's (1980)
example 28b. In her alternative structure (28c), which is identical to Liberman
and Prince's treatment, the inirial syllable is simply adjoined at the word level.
Though this choice always makes a difference in segmentation, it will only make a
difference in tree structure in the case of multifoot words such as Monongahela.
In such a case the 28b structure will adjoin the inirial syllable to the foot -nonga-,
whereas the 28c structure will adjoin it to the combination of the two feet
-nonga- and -hela. We know of no empirical arguments for one or the other,
beyond the musical parallel. Incidentally, Selkirk 1980 notes thar feer augmented
by an initial unstressed syllable occur only at the beginning of a word, not
word-internally, and argues that this fact should not have to be stipulated by the
theory that derives such structures. However, it is exactly parallel to the musical
case, where an augmented subgroup may occur only at the beginning of a group.
The parallelism suggests thar the stipularion against which Selkirk inveighs is not
so offensive after all.

8. Selkirk raises the possibility that in fact the directionality of the English rule 1s
only a preference rather than a necessity. This allows for the observed alternate
stressing in complex words such as Ticonderoga, by means far too complex to
describe here.

9. Readers familiar with hierarchical phonology will notice that our tree does not
contain category labels such as syllable and foot; these are present only in the
segmentation. This separation of functions avoids a notational problem that
arises in current conventional practice, where some nodes in the tree have only
category labels, some have only s or 1, and some have both.

10. This formularion has been designed to generalize to “upbear” syllables, which
receive separate treatment in Selkirk's exposition. In Liberman and Prince's ac-
count, the prominence contour of a foot is determined by the same rule that
creates the segmentation; the two functions are nor distinguished.

11. Prominence rule 2 is subject to a number of classes of exceptions, discussed at
length by Liberman and Prince.

12. We have nor discussed the constituency of the phonological phrase. Liberman
and Prince, following Chomsky and Halle (1968), take it to be essentially identi-
cal to nonlexical syntactic categories (NP, VP, etc.). However, Selkirk 1978 ar-
gues that a more complex relationship is involved. For the examples here, the rwo
views are indistinguishable.
