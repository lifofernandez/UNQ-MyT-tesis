time-span reduction (chapter 7). The overlapped and elided events in all
the passages cited above serve two different functions: as the end of a
cadence in the left group and as the beginning of the right group. By
stating the time-span reduction, which expresses these functions explic-
itly, in terms of underlying grouping structure, we can separate these two
functions cleanly.

In looking for analogs of the overlap and elision rules in linguistic
theory, two different parallels come to mind. First, with respect to their
place in the formal description, they resemble syntactic transformations
in linguistics, in that they increase the class of well-formed structures by
applying certain optional distortions to underlying structures. However,
in their substance they do not particularly resemble linguistic transfor-
mations, in that the distortions they introduce do not include such things
as movement of constituents (as in the passive or subject-auxiliary inver-
sion transformations of English). Rather, their effects are most like those
of highly local phonological rules that delete or assimilate material at
word boundaries (for example, the process that results in the pronuncia-
tion of only one slightly elongated d in the middle of the phrase dead
duck).

Having introduced a mechanism for the formal description of overlaps
and elisions, we must ask what evidence in the musical surface leads the
listener to hear them. Though we cannot at this point produce a detailed
account of the preference-rule mechanisms involved in the perception of
overlap and elision, the general outlines of a solution are fairly clear. In
example 3.25, for instance, parallelism suggests that a group begins on
the first beat of measure 3, but the local details suggest instead that a
group ends after the first beat of measure 3. If a group boundary could be
drawn after the V chord at the end of measure 2, the first group might be
perceived as ending in a half cadence. But local detail, particularly the
position of the V in the last eighth of the measure, does not support the
perception of a half cadence. Hence there is strong pressure toward
hearing the I at the beginning of measure 3 as the completion of a full
cadence. The two desiderata, motivic parallelism and cadence, can be
achieved simultaneously only if the groups overlap at the first beat of
measure 3.

This situation seems typical of overlaps and elisions: thematic consid-
erations require the start of a new group at a point where local detail and
cadential considerations strongly favor the continuation of an ongoing
group. We leave for future research a formal characterization of these
phenomena. Such a characterization clearly will involve not only group-
ing structure but also metrical structure and time-span reduction. Some
overlaps and elisions are accompanied by metrical irregularities; these
will be discussed briefly in chapter 4.
