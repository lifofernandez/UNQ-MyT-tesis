The Performer's
Influence on
Preferred Hearing

63

The performer of a piece of music, in choosing an interpretation, is in
effect deciding how he hears the piece and how he wants it heard. Among
the aspects of an interpretation will be a (largely unconscious) preferred
analysis of the piece with respect to the grammatical dimensions ad-
dressed by our theory. Because grouping structure is a crucial link
between the musical surface and the more abstract time-span and pro-
longational reductions, the perception of grouping is one of the more
important variables the performer can manipulate in projecting a par-
ticular conception of a piece.

The principal influence the performer has on grouping perception is in
his execution of local details, which affect the choice of small-level
grouping boundaries through GPRs 2 and 3 (the local detail rules) and of
larger boundaries through GPR 4 (the intensification rule). For example,
consider the very beginning of the Mozart Sonata K. 331. In 3.33 1t 1s
supplied with two possible groupings. (We favor grouping a, but group-
ing b has not been without its advocates; see Meyer 1973.)

The musical surface is in conflict between these two groupings. Since the
longest duration between attacks is after the quarter note, local detail
favors grouping b. But maximal motivic parallelism favors grouping a.
(If the piece began with an upbeat eighth, parallelism would favor b.) The
variations that follow take advantage of the potentialities in this group-
ing ambiguity, tipping the balance in favor of grouping b in variations 1,
2, and $ and in favor of grouping a in variations 3, 4, and 6.

A performer wishing to emphasize grouping a will sustain the quarter
note all the way to the eighth and will shorten the eighth and diminish its
volume. He thereby creates the most prominent break and change in
dynamics at the bar line, enhancing the effects of GPRs 2 and 3 there. On
the other hand, a performer who wishes to emphasize grouping b will
shorten the quarter, leaving a slight pause after it, and sustain the eighth
up to the next note. The effect of GPRs 2 and 3 is then relatively greater
before the eighth and less after it.

A second and less noticeable alteration the performer may make is a
slight shift in the attack point of the eighth, playing it a little early for
grouping a and a little late for grouping Â». This slight change in attack-
point distance also affects preferred grouping through its influence on
GPR 2.
