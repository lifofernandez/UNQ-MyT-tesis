The two sequences differ, however, in a crucial respect: the dots in the
first sequence are equidistant, but not those in the second. In other words,
the time-spans between successive beats are equal in 2.6a but unequal in
2.6b. Though a structure like 2.6b is conceivable in principle, it is not
what one thinks of as metrical; indeed, it would not be heard as such. The
term meter, after all, implies measuring—and 1t is difficult to measure
something without a fixed interval or distance of measurement. Meter
provides the means of such measurement for music; its function is to
mark off the musical flow, insofar as possible, into equal time-spans. In
short, metrical structure is inherently periodic. We therefore assert, as a
first approximation, that beats must be equally spaced. This disqualifies
the pattern of beats in 2.6b from being called metrical.

Curiously, neither is the pattern of beats in 2.6a metrical in any strict
sense. Fundamental to the idea of meter is the notion of periodic alterna-
tion of strong and weak beats; in 2.6a no such distinction exists. For
beats to be strong or weak there must exist a metrical hierarchy —two or
more levels of beats.* The relationship of “strong beat” to “metrical
level” is simply that, if a beat is felt to be strong at a particular level, it is
also a beat at the next larger level. In 4/4 meter, for example, the first and
third beats are felt to be stronger than the second and fourth beats, and
are beats at the next larger level; the first beat is felt to be stronger than
the third beat, and is a beat at the next larger level; and so forth. Trans-
lated into the dot notation, these relationships appear as the structure in
2.7a. At the smallest level of dots the first, second, third, and fourth beats
are all beats; at the intermediate level there are beats under numbers 1
and 3; and at the largest level there are beats only under number 1.

The pattern of metrical relations shown in 2.7a can also be represented
by “poetic” accents, as shown in 2.7b (—” means “strong” and “—”
means “weak”); but this traditional prosodic notation is inferior to the
dot notation in three respects. First, it does not treat beats as points in
time. Second, the distinction berween strong and weak beats is expressed
by two intrinsically unrelated signs rather than by patterns made up of
one sign. Third, by including strong and weak markings at each “level”
(that is, by turning two levels into one), the prosodic notation obscures
the true relationship between metrical level and strength of beat.
