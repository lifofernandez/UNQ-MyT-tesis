exception; although musically limited, his “analytic” approach to musical gram-
mar is in some ways more like ours than the “synthetic” grammars cited above.

8. An intrinsic advantage of our “analytic” approach to generative music theory
over the “synthetic” approaches listed in note 7 is that we can deal from the start
with a far wider range of literarure than the musically extremely limited sample
each of them generates.

9. This is a point often missed by musical laymen. For example, Hofstadter 1979
speaks of music as expressing the “structure of emorions,” but the only musical
structures actually discussed are the canonic and fugal structures of such works as
Bach's Musical Offering. Although we do not deny the interest of rhese struc-
rures, they are superficial to an understanding of Bach's or any other composer's
art. Their significance lies, rather, in how they mesh with the more fundamental,
and very different, kinds of musical structure discussed here. The affective con-
rent of music, we believe, lies in irs exploiration of the resources of the tonal
system to build dramaric structure. For an influential discussion of musical affect
in terms of strucrural “expectations,” see Meyer 1956.

10. Recent developments in generative linguistics (for example, Jackendoff 1972;
Bresnan 1978) have considerably weakened the role of transformations in favor
of enriched phrase-structure grammar, lexicon, and semantic interpretation. In
this respect our music theory more closely resembles current linguistic theory
than thar of Chomsky 1957, in that ir accounts for structure in terms of the
interacrion of several components which individually are relatively restricred. For
another possible notion of musical transformational rule, which we reject, see
section 11.4.

1. Andrew Imbrie (personal communication) has suggested possible examples of
overlaps like j. We are inclined to regard them as strucrural ambiguiries, that is,
passages where two competing plausible groupings can be assigned. Though
secrion 3.4 treats only overlaps like í, the theory could easily be expanded to
accommodate case ; should this prove necessary.

2. Sessions (1951, pp. 82—92) makes essentially the same distincrions; his “accent
of weight” corresponds to strucrural accent, and, in a more restricted sense, his
“expressive accent” corresponds to phenomenal accent. Cooper and Meyer
(1960, pp. 6-8) distinguish berween “stress” (phenomenal accent) and “accent,”
bur do not adequately define che larter term; they appear to intend it to mean
metrical accent combined with aspects of grouping structure and of struccural
accent.

3. Imbrie (1973, p. 53) and, in effect, Komar (1971, p. 52) precede us in observ-
ing thar bears are durationless points in rime. The spatial analogy comes from
Imbrie. Komar (p. 36) also uses the term time-span in the sense we intend.

4. Yeston 1976 (p. 67) also points this our.

5. Because Komar (1971), by analogy with Schenker's pitch theory, artempts to
develop a metrical theory derived from “background” metrical levels, ler us
enumerate a few more general reservarions we have about this approach. First, it
is an unacceptable simplificarion to argue, as Komar must, rhar harmonic arrival
(structural accent) and large-scale metrical accent must coincide. This require-
ment becomes especially problematic when one must choose berween strucrural
beginnings and cadences, which together form spans thar are anything but
equidistant. (We trear this matter in section 2.4.) Second, with pieces having any
sectiona! irregularity ar all (that is, with most pieces), how an analysis gets from
