2. (Pitch-collection condition)*

A connection between two events is more stable ¡f they involve or imply a
common diatonic collection.

3. (Melodic condition)

a. (Distance) A connection between two events is melodically more sta-
ble if the interval between them is smaller (with the exception of the
octave, which is relatively stable).

b. (Direction) An ascending melodic progression is most stable as a
right-branching structure; a descending one is most stable as a left-
branching structure.

4. (Harmonic condition)*

a. (Distance) A connection between two events is harmonically more
stable if their roots are closer on the circle of fifths.

b. (Direction) A progression thart ascends along the circle of fifths is
most stable as a right-branching structure; one thar descends along
the circe of fifths or produces a subdominant-to-dominant relation-
ship 1s most stable as a left-branching structure.

Interaction Principle (p. 228)

In order to make a sufficiently stable prolongational connection, ey must
be chosen from the events in the two most important levels of time-span
reduction represented in (e;—e)).

PRPR 4 (Prolongational Importance) (p. 226)

Let ex be the prolongationally most important event in a region (e;—e;).
Prefer a prolongational reduction in which e; is an elaboration of the
prolongationally more important of the endpoints.

PRPR 5 (Parallelism) (p. 226)
Prefer a prolongational reduction in which parallel passages receive par-
allel analyses.

PRPR 6 (Normative Prolongational Structure)* (p. 234)

A cadenced group preferably contains four (five) elements in its prolon-

gational structure:

a. a prolongational beginning,

b. a prolongational ending consisting of one element of the cadence,

(c. a right-branching prolongation as the most inportant direct elabora-
tion of the prolongational beginning,)

d.a right-branching progression as the (next) most important direct
elaboration of the prolongational beginning,

e. a left-branching “subdominant” progression as the most important
elaboration of the first element of the cadence.
