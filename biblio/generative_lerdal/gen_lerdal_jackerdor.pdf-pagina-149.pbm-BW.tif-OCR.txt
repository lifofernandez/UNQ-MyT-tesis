The chorale oscillates throughout between the tonic and its relative mi-
nor. In fact, in its last, chromatic harmonization (just after Christ's death
in the Passion story), this tonal relationship is virtually reversed, by
means of the tentative beginning on the relative minor and the ineffable
close on the dominant of the relative minor.

A reduction such as 6.25 can be a valuable source for analytic insights,
locating them within a coherent design. Consider for example level e, in
which only the structural accents of each phrase remain. Here, as
sketched in 6.26, the inner logic of the melody becomes manifest.

Every odd-numbered phrase returns to its structural origin via lower-
neighbor motion; every even-numbered phrase progresses and resolves
by descending stepwise a third. (The only exception, the last phrase, by
not resolving to D but returning to F$, repeats the underlying structure of
the opening phrase.) This melodic alternation is complemented and clari-
fied by registral alternation from phrase to phrase. In the second half,
however, the registers reverse from a low-high, low-high pattern to a
high-low, high-low pattern, while the melodic alternation continues as
before. This reversal highlights the symmetrical organization of the piece,
in particular the obligatory nature of the repeat of the first two phrases.
Not only does each even-numbered phrase answer the previous odd-
numbered phrase, but the second half answers the first half.

Such observations could of course be continued. The point to em-
phasize here is that, although time-span reduction may not itself draw
such connections, it does provide the framework for them. Without the
framework the connections would not exist.
