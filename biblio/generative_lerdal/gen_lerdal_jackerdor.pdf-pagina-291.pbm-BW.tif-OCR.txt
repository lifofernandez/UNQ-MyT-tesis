Second, we have restricted ourselves in this study to a formalization of
the hierarchical aspects of musical structure. For the most part, the de-
velopment of musical surface material is not a hierarchical phenomenon.
For example, that motive A has been transformed into A', and A' into A”,
does not mean that any of them has hierarchical priority over the others.
Rather, they are a sequence of musical units that are perceived simply as
being related to one another in certain ways. Insofar as there is a sense in
which a hierarchical relation might exist among these motivic forms—if,
for example, A' is heard for contextual reasons as more “basic” or
“characteristic” than A—rhe resulting hierarchical description would
not be of the kind that has been under consideration here, namely an
exhaustive partitioning into hierarchical, nonoverlapping segments or
elements.

The discussion in section 3.3 suggests an alternative attack on the
problem of motivic “transformation”: motivic relatedness counts as an
instance of parallelism. There we advocated seeking a set of preference
rules to pick out parallelisms. Such rules would take into account not
only the obvious factors of surface pitch contour and rhythmic configu-
ration, but also more contextual or global considerations, such as posi-
tion of the motive in grouping structure, its metrical pattern, and its
reductional structure. Intuitions about motivic relatedness display all the
characteristics we have come to associate with phenomena governed by
preference rules, in particular the gradations in judgment due to the
interaction of diverse factors. Thus our theory provides a formal possi-
bility for expressing motivic relatedness through preference rules, which
circumvents the difficulties engendered by a more traditional “transfor-
mational” approach.

Another question that may arise in connection with our methodology
concerns “deep structure” —a technical term that has been widely mis-
understood. It should first be pointed out that the largest levels of our
reductions are in no sense analogous to deep structures in linguistics.
Rather, they are analogous to stages of phrase-structure analysis as rep-
resented in linguistic trees. Thus the highest level in one of our reductions
(always the tonic chord) roughly corresponds to “Sentence,” our second
largest level (the “basic form” in prolongational reduction) roughly cor-
responds to “Noun Phrase + Verb Phrase,” and so forth. However, as
pointed out in section 5.3, musical trees represent elaborations rather
than ¿s-a relations among grammatical categories, so even this analogy
should not be pushed too far. (A more apt linguistic analogy to reduc-
tional trees 1s discussed in section 12.3.)

In a transformational generative grammar, “deep structure” refers to
underlying phrase structures that have not been subjected to transforma-
tions (in the technical sense). “Surface structure” refers to the constituent
structure of actual linguistic expressions. Transformations convert deep
