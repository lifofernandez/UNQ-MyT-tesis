forces alterations: the brackets at the half-note level and larger are trun-
cated just to the left of the fourth beat of measure 12, and the corre-
sponding brackets to the right of this beat are enlarged so as to include it
as an upbeat. Any such enlarged bracketing we call an augmented time-
span. In this way a unified time-span segmentation is achieved in a man-
ner compatible with the criterion that a group is a time-span.

In 6.4 an additional bracket is required at the half-note level at the
beginning of measure 13: beats 1 and 2 are bracketed together within a
regular time-span, since their relation is unmodified by the grouping
boundary in measure 12, and then beat 4 of measure 12 is added to form
the augmented time-span. Because the augmented time-span contains the
regular time-span, this procedure grants a slight prominence to events on
upbeats. This formal detail appears to mirror perceptual experience.

Example 65 illustrates the subgroup bracketing for a thoroughly out-
of-phase passage, the opening theme of Mozart's G Minor Symphony.
The inner tension of this music is in part a product of the rhythmic
conflict between the periodicity of the metrical structure (reinforced by
the accompaniment) and the complexity of the time-spans resulting from
such out-of-phase conditions.

Previous approaches to time-span reduction have been based exclu-
sively on some metrical conception. We surmise that this has been so only
because it has not been customary to develop grouping and meter as
independent yet interactive components. In any case, we have just shown
that a purely metrical approach to time-span segmentation is accurate
only for in-phase passages.

A second argument against an exclusively metrical conception of
time-span reduction is that the perception of meter fades at large levels
(as argued in section 2.2). Thus a reductional procedure based on large-
scale metrical relations would have little basis in musical experience. A
related argument concerns the fact that time-span segmentation is often
irregular at intermediate levels because of surface irregularities in the
music. An exclusively metrical conception would have to make these
spans regular at an underlying level. This approach may be satisfactory
for certain cases (essentially, for clear-cut extensions or contractions
within an otherwise regular context), but in general it is problematic.
