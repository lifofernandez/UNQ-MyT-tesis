For cases where relatively low pitch of the bass has an influence, con-

7.19

 

Example 7.19a, from the Mozart G Minor Symphony, brings back an
Issue raised in section 4.3. There we argued that the low G in the bass
reinforces the choice of metrical structure, because it is more important
than the high G in the time-span reduction. TSRPR 3b brings about the
desired distinction in importance. (If the high and low bass notes were
exchanged in 7.19a, metrical perceptions would be affected.)

Example 7.19b illustrates an octave drop of the bass beneath a 1$-V
progression in a cadence. In the first half of the measure, the V7 on the
second beat is chosen over the 14 by TSRPR 2a. However, the progression
would be somewhat weaker ¡f the low G in the bass were on the first
rather than the second beat. This suggests that the low G on the second
beat helps the V7 overcome the strong metrical position of the 15. In fact,
the bass line in 7.19b is a cliché of tonal music, but an upward leap of an
octave rarely occurs. The reinforcing interaction of TSRPRs 2a and 3b,
overriding TSRPR 1, demonstrates a principled basis for this disparity.

Nonlocal Pitch Influences

Time-span reduction preference rules 1-3 describe factors internal to a
time-span that affect the choice of its head. We now turn to influences
that involve material outside of the time-span as well. In general it is
difficult to separate these principles, because of their constant interaction
with local principles and with each other, so our motivation for them will
be more suggestive than rigorous.

The first of these principles is the inevitable rule of parallelism. For
example, consider again the opening of K. 331 (7.18c). Suppose someone
were, for whatever reason, to adopt the analysis in which the quarter-
note E in the first measure is the structurally most important event. Then,
because of the parallelism of the first two measures, it would be absurd
