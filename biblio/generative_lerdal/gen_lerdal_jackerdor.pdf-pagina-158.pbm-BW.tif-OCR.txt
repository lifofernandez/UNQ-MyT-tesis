We will represent the fusion of two events in the tree by joining their
branches with a crossbar. Example 7.11 illustrates the reduction of 7.10
by fusion, giving the lower branches of the resulting tree.

Example 7.12 is the beginning of the same movement; its tree contains
multiple levels of fusion, showing that each half-measure is heard as the
arpeggiation of a chord. (The dissonant neighbor tones are eliminated by
ordinary reduction at the eighth-note level.)*

Fusion, unlike ordinary reduction, is limited to relatively local levels.
Although one may hear long-range arpeggiation of.a chord, one does not
fuse the elements into a single chord heard over the entire interval of
time. The proper delimitation appears to be that events cannot be fused ¡f
they are separated by a group boundary. This “locality” condition is
provisionally incorporated into the well-formedness rules below. Its ef-
fect is shown in the reduction in 7.12: each pair of half-measures is not
fused into a single event at the whole-note level; rather, the second half-
measure is treated as a repetition of the first that is eliminated by ordi-
nary reduction. This follows from the locality condition, because each
half-measure forms a group.

Fusion in time-span reduction corresponds to the perceptual phe-
nomenon of “auditory stream segregation,” where one hears two voices
instead of a single oscillating one (Bregman and Campbell 1971). The
fact that auditory stream segregation is not confined to musical inputs
suggests that time-span reduction has some connection to nonmusical
auditory perception. We see two opposing ways in which such a connec-
