problems, describing a topological manifold in which geometrical dis-
tance corresponds roughly to relative stability of prolongational connec-
tion (that is, of harmonic and melodic relationship).

The most highly detailed work on visual theory in this vein is that
reported in Marr 1982. Marr divides the mapping from the presented
visual field to visual structure into a number of steps, each of which is a
mapping berween two discrete levels of structure. Each of the levels of
structure he posits is defined explicitly, and the mappings between them
are equally explicit, to the point where a meaningful computer simulation
is possible. Although Marr's model does not extend all the way to the
level of object recognition, those steps he has described are successful in
accounting for many important properties of visual perception. Elements
of this theory have been incorporated into subsequent work such as Ull-
mann 1979 and Kosslyn 1980,

In its overall form, Marr's theory is similar to our theory of music.
Each level of visual structure is characterized by a set of principles analo-
gous to well-formedness rules. Moreover, the mappings berween levels of
visual structure rely on principles that operate exactly like our preference
rules. Principles may reinforce each other or conflict; when there is con-
flict, the outcome may be ambiguous or one principle may override the
other, depending on their relative strengths of application.

Thus, within modern theories of human visual information processing,
many features of Gestalt theory have survived and many analogs to our
music theory have emerged. Moreover, the mentalist and innatist posi-
tion of Gestalt theory is quite in tune with contemporary work. For
example, Shepard 1980 contains repeated references to our ability to
perceive the world as we do in terms of the outcome of evolution shaping
the innate nature of the visual system.

What has not survived from Gestalt psychology is its attempt at physi-
ological reduction. But when viewed as computational principles, the
Gestalt laws of organization seem inevitably to play a role. Thus our
appeal to principles of Gestalt psychology is not anachronistic. We have
used them in a fashion compatible with modern work in visual theory.
We have found it useful to refer to the earlier work, despite its lack of
explicitness, because of its directness and clarity in addressing some of
the more fundamental issues of psychological inquiry that are simply
assumed by more recent work.

As promised in chapter 1, the generative music theory developed here
does not look much like generative linguistics. This section will point out
certain formal relationships that are not immediately obvious.

The difference in methodology between the two theories, mentioned in
section 1.2, is symptomatic: whereas linguistic theory is highly concerned
