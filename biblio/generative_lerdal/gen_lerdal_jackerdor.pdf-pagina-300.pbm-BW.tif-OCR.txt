each addressing a different way of combining pitches. First, principles of
melodic stability define the relative stability of intervals in the horizontal
motion of a single voice. Second, principles of harmonic stability define
the relative stability among possible vertical combinations of pitches.
These two differ in various respects—most markedly in their treatment
of the interval of the second, which is the most stable melodic motion but
highly dissonant harmonically. Third, the horizontal and vertical dimen-
sions combine in principles of harmonic progression (such as relatedness
by the circle of fifths). Traditional theory has employed all three of these
kinds of principles, usually without clearly distinguishing them. We too
have made use of these principles in stating the preference rules for the
two reductional components, without feeling obliged to spell them out in
detail since they are so well known. Obviously a complete theory of the
idiom would be as explicit in this area as we have been in others.

Though open to wide variation, these three general characteristics are
essential to any notion of tonality, no matter how broadly conceived.
Their pervasiveness suggests that they form an important part of the
cognitive organization with which listeners structure musical experience.
However, the differences among tonal systems represent aspects of mu-
sical structure that a listener must learn (for the most part unconsciously)
in order to become “experienced.” At the same time, the fact that certain
trends appear among simpler tonal systems (for example, the frequent
use of small-ratio intervals as points of harmonic stability, and the preva-
lence of some kinds of pentatonic scales over others) suggests the possi-
bility of an innate system of preferences among tonal systems analogous
to the principles of markedness in phonological systems of language pro-
posed in Trubetzkoy 1939 and Jakobson 1941. These would not dictate
the specifics of tonal systems, but would aid the learner in the selection of
hypotheses about the tonal system he is trying to learn. In other words,
one could regard the “inexperienced listener” as seeking a grammar to
organize some corpus of musical surfaces that he hears; the markedness
principles would guide him toward certain possibilities and away from
others. We leave a more thorough investigation of this topic for future
research.

A limited amount of the world's music, particularly a great deal of
twentieth-century art music, would appear to be an exception to the
musical universals proposed in this chapter. Even where there is a tonal
center, much contemporary music does not offer a coherent measure of
relative pitch stability, much of it denies a tonal center altogether.
Moreover, a regular metrical hierarchy is often not conveyed, even if the
music is notated in traditional terms. Through extreme motivic “trans-
formations” or even the avoidance of motivic content, much of this music
withholds evidence for structural parallelism that would lead to any rich
