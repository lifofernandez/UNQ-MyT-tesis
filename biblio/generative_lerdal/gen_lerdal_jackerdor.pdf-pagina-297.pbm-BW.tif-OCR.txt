if the overtone hypothesis were correct, for it shows that tonality is not
simply man's response to physical facts about sound. Rather, like lan-
guage, tonality in music provides evidence for a cognitive organization
with a logic all its own. The mind is not simply following the physical
path of least resistance, as the overtone hypothesis would have it, but is
creating its own way of organizing pitch combinations into coherent
patrerns.”

It 1s interesting that Helmholtz (1885), after studying the acoustics of
tonality and the overtone series in great detail, arrives at a rather similar
conclusion (pp. 364—365):

... the principle of tonal relationship [through the overtone series] did not at all
times exclusively derermine the construction of the scale, and does not even yet
determine it exclusively among all nations. This principle must, therefore, be
regarded to some extent as a freely selected principle of stvle [Helmholtz's
Iralics]. ... the construction of scales and of harmonic tissue is a product of
artistic invention, and by no means furnished by the natural formation or narural
function of our ear, as it has been hitherto most generally asserted.

In seeking an alternative account of tonality, one can imagine any
number of possible sets of first principles from which to build the pitch
system of classical Western tonal music. The question arises as to which
of the possible methods of deriving the system accurately reflects the
experienced listener's unconscious knowledge of the tonal pitch system.
One kind of evidence that bears on this question comes from an exami-
nation of the pitch structures of other tonal idioms of the world (possibly
excluding consciously “invented” systems). If one finds a set of first
principles that can be elaborated equally into any of these various sys-
tems, this is more likely to be a description of psychological interest, for it
represents all tonal systems as different realizations of the same cognitive
capacity.

The above statements should be explained in more detail. We claim
that listeners use their musical cognitive capacity to organize music they
hear, and further that musical idioms will tend to develop along lines that
enable listeners to make use of their abilities to organize musical signals.
Therefore, if there is some kind of organization that is especially “nat-
ural” (that is, favored by musical cognitive capacity), we should expect
this sort of organization to be widespread among musical idioms. (On the
other hand, we do not expect all idioms to exploit all aspects of musical
cognition equally. For example, the Macedonian folk idiom mentioned in
section 4.4 makes heavier use of certain metrical possibilities than classi-
cal Western tonal music, which in turn uses more possibilities of pitch
organization than many other idioms.)

Thus we believe that a basis for classical Western tonality should be
developed in part by searching for the underlying features it shares with
other tonal systems. (Section 4.4 suggested similar investigation with
