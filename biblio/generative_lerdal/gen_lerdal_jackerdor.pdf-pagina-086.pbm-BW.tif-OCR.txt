the durations of forte and piano. The greater length of the piano now
attracts the strong beat, but so does the stress of the forte. Because of the
conflict, either structure ¿ Or structure ¿¿ can be heard, but with more
equivocation than structure ¿ in 4.26a. Thus the two passages in 4.26
present the familiar contrast berween reinforcement and conflict of pref-
erence rules.

Continuing with the generalization of MPR 5, we observe that the
beginning of a slur is indicative of a strong beat. In example 4.27 the
most highly preferred pattern places the beginning of the slur at a strong
beat on both the quarter-note and half-note levels, as indicated below the
passage.

Furthermore, the longer of two slurs most naturally occurs on a relatively
stronger beat: in 4.28 structure £ is preferable to structure 7í. Thus slur-
ring has the same properties with respect to metrical preference rules as
long notes and changes of dynamics.

A third extension of MPR $ concerns the length of a consistent pattern
of articulation. An especially salient example is 4.29, from the Courante
of the fourth Bach Cello Suite, in which it is difficult to hear the down-
beats at any point other than at the change from triplets to sixteenths and
back again.
