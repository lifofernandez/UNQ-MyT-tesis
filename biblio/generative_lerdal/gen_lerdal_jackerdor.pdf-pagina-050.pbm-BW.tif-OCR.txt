GPR 3 (Change) Consider a sequence of four notes 7,79737,. All else

being equal, the transition 7,—3 may be heard as a group boundary if

a. (Register) the transition 1,—73 involves a greater intervallic distance
than both 7,-7, and n;—n,, orif

b. (Dynamics) the transition 1,—7; involves a change in dynamics and
n1-n3 and n3—74 do not, or if

c. (Articulation) the transition 7,—73 involves a change in articulation
and 7,-, and n,—-7n, do not, orif

d. (Length) , and n; are of different lengths and both pairs ,,, and
n3,14 do not differ in length.

(One might add further cases to deal with such things as change in timbre

or instrumentation.)

This rule too relies on a transition as being distinctive with respect to the
transitions on both sides. Example 3.17, like 3.15, illustrates cases where
transitions are distinctive with respect only to the transition on one side;
grouping intuitions are again much less secure than in 3.16.

 

As observed in the preceding section, the various cases of GPRs 2 and 3
may reinforce each other, producing a stronger sense of boundary, as in
3.18a. Alternatively, different cases of the rules may come into conflict,
as in 3.18b-—3.18d. In these examples each caret is labeled with the cases
of GPRs 2 and 3 that apply.

 

In 3.18b-—3.18d there is evidence for a group boundary between both the
second and third notes and between the third and fourth notes. However,
GPR 1 prohibits both being group boundaries at once, since that would
result in the third note alone constituting a group. Thus only one of the
transitions may be a group boundary, and the evidence is conflicting.
This prediction by the formal theory corresponds to the intuition that the
grouping judgment is somewhat less secure in 3.18b-—3.18d than in
3.18a, where all the evidence favors a single position for the group
boundary.

Although judgments are weaker for 3.18b—3.18d than for 3.18a, they
