chosen as head over the I5 by TSRPR 2a. At the third beat of measure 1,
the IV* and the V$ are again approximately in balance with respect to
TSRPR 2, so voice-leading considerations come into play, choosing the
dominant chord as head. At the fourth beat, the consonance in the sec-
ond eighth is a clear choice by TSRPR 2. In combining the third and
fourth beats of measure 1 into a time-span, the I (despite its weaker
metrical position) is harmonically more stable than the V$ with respect to
both criteria in TSRPR 2. Finally, in the first half of measure 2, the V on
the second beat is both intrinsically more stable and closer to the tonic
than the ii$ on the first beat.

In addition to the two local TSRPRs discussed so far, a third and
somewhat weaker principle can be stated as follows:

TSRPR 3 (Registral Extremes) Of the possible choices for head of a
time-span T, weakly prefer a choice that has

a. a higher melodic pitch

b. a lower bass pitch.

In practice, this consideration rarely has a decisive effect unless the har-
mony and the metrical position are otherwise identical, but it may have a
supplementary reinforcing or weakening influence.

Example 7.18 illustrates cases where TSRPR 3a affects judgments.

 

 

 

 

In 7.18a, from the finale of Beethoven's Wind Octet, op. 103, one tends
to hear the Eb of the anacrusis as more prominent, despite its weaker
metrical position. That this is due to its higher pitch 1s clear from com-
parison with 7.18b, where the G is heard as primary.

Example 7.18c returns to Mozart's K. 331. Schenker (1925) analyzes
the E in the second half of the first measure as the structurally most
important event in spite of its relatively weak metrical position. The
plausibility of this judgment is due to the higher pitch of the E. If the
pitches were changed to those of 7.18d it would be implausible to choose
the event in weaker metrical position, because it is now lower. Thus,
although we disagree with Schenker here (because of the bass and the
metrical structure), his analysis does receive support from TSRPR 3a. (See
section 10.4 for further discussion of Schenker's alternative.)
