structured on such principles will tend to reveal an Ursatz at the most

global reductional level; it is not necessary to posit such a structure in

advance. The Ursatz is an effect, not a cause, of tonal principles.

From this it follows that reductions of tonally unstable pieces probably
will not result in a stepwise melodic descent, or possibly even a I-V-I
progression. Rather than make such cases conform somehow to an a
priori conception, it is illuminating to see how they deviate from proto-
typical cases. (An intriguing example in this respect will be discussed in
section 9.6. For a general discussion of “models,” see section 11.4.)

A related issue of interest to Schenkerian theory concerns the location
of the structural dominant (the most important V in a piece or passage).
It is obvious that a typical tonal piece begins and ends on the tonic. Less
clear is where that crucial V occurs, particularly in the pervasive “inter-
ruption” forms (which include, among others, the antecedent-consequent
period and sonata form). Figure 6.21 diagrams the essentials of an inter-
ruption form: the tonic moves to a half cadence (or possibly to a toniciz-
ing cadence on V); then a reprise on the tonic leads to a completion of the
interrupted half cadence by a full cadence. Is the structural dominant the
V at the half cadence, or the V at the final cadence??

Because of the labeling of cadences and their relation to grouping
structure, our theory asserts unequivocally that the structural dominant,
in interruption form or any other tonal form, is the V at the full cadence
that resolves the piece (or passage) as a whole. The tree shown in 6.22 for
the structural accents of the opening eight bars of K. 331 will illustrate:
the half cadence (measure 4) plays a role only in measures 1—4, but the
final V functions cadentially for both measures 5-8 and measures 1-8.
(If necessary, consult the ball-throwing representation 1n 6.17.)

We offer the following general arguments in support of this position.
First, the selection of the V in measure 4—or, more generally, any merely
centrally located and salient dominant—would not reflect tonal princi-
ples as a whole, since many passages or pieces do not have an available V
at the equivalent place. For instance, where would one find the structural
dominant in the entire 18-bar theme of K. 331 (6.20) if not in the final
cadence? The most centrally located dominant, the V in measure 8,
clearly resolves in measure 8. More plausible is the half-cadential V in
measure 12; but this is too deeply embedded in the grouping structure,
especially if the repeats are observed, to function for the theme as a
whole. Thus the final V is the only satisfactory choice.
