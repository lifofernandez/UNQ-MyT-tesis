Overlapping as well as vertical, horizontal, and diagonal configurations
would have to be allowed. Then, out of these possible segmentations,
preference rules would select sets actually heard by the experienced lis-
tener. Here parallels to the grouping principles of proximity (GPR 2),
similarity (GPR 3), and parallelism (GPR 6) would be relevant. Sets se-
lected at the smallest level would then be related to one another, or
combined into larger sets, according to principles of relatedness already
partly developed in the atonal theoretical literature. There would un-
doubtedly be interaction between choice of larger-scale sets and grouping
structure as developed here.

A further step might involve partial pitch hierarchies. By implication,
current atonal set theory regards all pitches contained within a set as
somehow equal. To the ear, however, this is not so. Even without a
general scale of pitch stability, structural importance tends to be attrib-
uted to events perceived as salient at the musical surface (for example,
events that are loud in their contexts, or notes at registral extremes). In
other words, structural importance in atonal music may be induced in
large part from phenomenal accent. The most salient event in a set could
thus be analyzed as its head. In turn, the heads of contiguous sets might
go on to form sets at the next level. Unlike the events at the smallest level,
these events would not have to be contiguous at the musical surface. Thus
we would arrive at a kind of reduction of the piece, stated over set
structure instead of time-span segmentation. But it is doubtful that such
reductions could be carried very far.

To pursue these ideas further would take us beyond the scope of this
book. We have tried only to show how our approach might bear on
atonal theory. Most theory about contemporary music has been occupied
either with the description of compositional systems or with the sys-
tematization of analytic procedures not directly related to the listener's
understanding. Our approach emphasizes that there is a crucial distinc-
tion between the principles by which a piece is composed and the prin-
ciples by which it is heard (that is, those that permit the listener to
construct a mental representation of the piece). As theorists, we are con-
cerned only with the latter.

The relevance of this distinction to the description of atonal and serial
music pertains with equal or greater force to probabilistic methods of
composition, to aleatoric methods, to serialism extended to the rhythmic
dimension, or to any other procedures that do not directly engage the
listener's ability to organize a musical surface. In each of these cases, the
gulf berween compositional and perceptual principles is wide and deep:
insofar as the listener's abilities are not engaged, he cannot infer a rich
organization no matter how a piece has been composed or how densely
packed its musical surface is. It is in this sense that an apparently simple
Mozart sonata is more complex than many twentieth-century pieces that
at first seem highly intricate.
