We start with the eighth-note level, which is of course assigned by the
MWFRs (MWEFR 1 requires a beat at the attack point of each note, and
MWER 4 fills the level in evenly). Those beats at the eighth-note level that
coincide with beginnings of notes are marked by MPR 3 (the event rule);
rests and continuations of notes are not marked. There are no local
stresses, so MPR 4 has no effect (though stresses are often added at 11 and
27 in performance to reinforce the metrical structure). MPR Sa (length of
pitch-event) marks the beginning of the quarter notes; MPR Sc (length of
slur) marks the beginning of the slurs. The beginnings of repeated pitches
are marked by MPR Se. Finally, MPR Sf (length of harmony) applies at
the change at 27 (beat 1 has been preceded by accompaniment, so it is not
a harmonic change).5

Examining the totality of rule applications at this level, we find a
situation not unlike 4.16b above: clusters of three adjacent beats where
rules apply, followed by a beat with no rule applications. As in 4.16b,
rule applications on weak beats can be minimized by assigning strong
beats to the first and third beats of each cluster, giving the quarter-note
level shown in 4.35.

Now let us determine the strong beats at the quarter-note level. At this
level, every beat except 15 and 31 occurs at the inception of a pitch-event
and therefore is marked by MPR 3. The quarter notes are relatively long
