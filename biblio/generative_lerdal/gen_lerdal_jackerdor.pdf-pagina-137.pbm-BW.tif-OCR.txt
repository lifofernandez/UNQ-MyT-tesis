Time-Span Trees
and Structural
Accents

In closing this section we must caution that the formal theory resides
only in the trees, not in the secondary notation, even though the latter is a
close translation of the former. We retain both because the tree notation
is unfamiliar, and because, as will become clearer in longer examples, the
two notations serve somewhat different purposes. The tree gives a picture
of all the levels in relation to one another; the notation below the music is
useful in hearing any particular level.

A further cautionary word is needed about the labeling of levels. This,
too, is not part of the formal theory. It will turn out that the formal
theory does not require that one branching at level 7 correspond strictly
to another branching at level 7 in some other part of a piece. This
restriction is not feasible because of the frequent irregularity of depth of
embedding in the time-span segmentation, especially at global levels of
analysis. Nonetheless, we keep the labeling of levels because in this kind
of reduction it has a meaning— namely, that the time-spans partition a
piece into approximately equal parts at any given level, and therefore the
structurally most important event in one span can be ranked with an-
other such event in another span of about the same length. No doubt
music is perceived, to a degree, as progressing at an even rate of events
from level to level. This is what the labeling of levels addresses.

In section 2.4 we claimed that the structural accents of the phrase—its
structural beginning (abbreviated b) andrits structural ending, or cadence
(abbreviated c) —belong in a music theory not as part of metrical struc-
ture but as part of time-span reduction. It is time to make good that
claim. Again we begin schematically. We revive the analogy of section
2.4: like a ball thrown and caught, the overarching elements of a phrase
are its structural beginning and its cadence, In section 2.4 we dia-
grammed this state of affairs as in 6.13a. Now we can be less impres-
sionistic: the b and c of a phrase must emerge as its structurally most
important events in the time-span reduction, in the form of either 6.13b
or 6.13c, depending on whether the b dominates the c (6.13b) or vice
versa (6.13c).
