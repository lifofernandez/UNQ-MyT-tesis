The term “strongly” in this rule is meant to indicate that this preference
rule is sufficient to override the powerful combination of harmonic and
metrical strength, as in measure 4 of K. 331.

To state TSRPR 7 more carefully, we must work out the conditions
under which an event or a pair of events in some level of time-span
reduction functions as a cadence. First, the correct harmonic sequence
must be present for a full, half, or deceptive cadence. Second, the final
element must actually mark the end of a group. For example, in measures
9-12 of the Chopin A Major Prelude (7.23), the sequence V —I cannot be
heard as a cadence because of the Vhi following the I in the group.”

7.23

 

To refine this requirement, we observe that intuitively a cadence must
be a cadence of something; a group that consisted only of the articulation
of its ending would be unsatisfying. For instance, measures 1-—8 of the
same prelude (7.24) consists of two V—I progressions. (For convenience,
the reduction in 7.24 simplifies the voice leading to the essential soprano
and bass lines.) The first of the V-I progressions, since it completely
occupies the first four-measure group, is not really heard as a cadence.
Therefore, only the V or the I may be retained at the next level. By
contrast, the V —I progression in measures 5—8 is a cadence for the entire
eight-measure group, and therefore should be retained as a whole in the
reduction. As a result, the reduction at the four-measure level contains
either the V or the l of the first group followed by the cadence. (The piece
is genuinely ambiguous here between the reduction in 7.24 and that with
an initial I instead. For a number of reasons, including parallelism with
the second half, we find that the choice of V yields a more stable analysis
overall. This piece is discussed further in section 9.6.)

We can make the intuition about the first four measures of 7.24 more
precise by introducing the notion of a cadenced group: a group that at
some level of reduction reduces to two elements, the second of which is a
cadence. The first of these elements is the structural beginning of the
group, and the cadence is the structural ending. In section 6.3 we labeled
these with the notations [b] and [c], followed by a subscript to indicate
for which groups they were structural accents.

Cadenced groups are to be contrasted with lower-level groups, which
do not contain bs and cs. The smallest levels of cadenced groups cor-
respond rather closely to the traditional notion of musical phrase.
