The problem now becomes simply to select the structurally most im-
portant event in each time-span, in a cyclical fashion from level to level.
This process is illustrated schematically in 5.12. (In the example, we have
omitted the events below the dotted-quarter-note level. The vi? is given in
quotes because it is hardly a chord in a normal sense; the labeling is for
convenience.)

5.12

 

For each time-span in 5.12, a single event is chosen as the most impor-
tant event, or head. For instance, in the span covering measure 2, the V*
is chosen over the V3, and proceeds for consideration in the span covering
measures 1—2; here it is less stable than the opening I, so it does not
proceed to the next larger span; and so forth. As a result of this proce-
dure, a particular time-span level produces a particular reductional level
(the sequence of heads of the time-spans at that level).

Note how the events marked 7 and 7 in 5.12, which were unhappily
so prominent in $.10, have already disappeared at the half-measure level.
This is a result of their having had to “compete” in an environment (the
span of the half-measure) in which they “lost” to another event; they
never had a chance to attach at larger levels. Thus meter and grouping
have placed constraints on how the pitch structure is heard.

Such in principle is time-span reduction.? When we develop it in the
next chapter, we will explain more fully how it represents the interaction
of pitch and rhythmic structure.
