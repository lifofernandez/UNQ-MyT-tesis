There are now two regions to consider: berween the two Is and from
the second I to the final V. Let us deal with the latter first. The ii and the
L are equal in time-span importance, so PRPR 1 does not apply. Of the
four possible connections between these two chords and the endpoints,
the most stable is the left-branching descending fifth progression from the
1i to the V, so the ii is chosen as ex. Then the $ must attach to either the
ii* or the V. Because of the arrival in the bass, it attaches to the V, as in
9.14.

The part of the tree just developed is one of the cadential formulas
presented in section 8.3. The ii5, despite its relative unimportance in the
time-span reduction, has emerged as relatively important in the prolon-
gational reduction: it is the most important left branch of the cadential V.

Next we turn to the region between the two Is in 9.14. The V* and the
“vi?” are again most time-span-important, but the most stable harmonic
connection is from the initial I to the I6. The Interaction Principle as
applied so far selects the I$ as most important; however, intuition favors
the V*. There are two local influences supporting this intuition. First, the
V* is melodically closer to the I than the I* is, and the events involved are
at a local enough level here that melodic connection, in both the soprano
and the bass, plays a decisive role. Thus PRPR 3 is itself conflicted be-
tween harmonic and melodic closeness, so that the 1 is not clearly a more
stable connection than the V%. PRPR 1 therefore prevails, choosing the V*
for its time-span importance. The second factor in the choice of the V*
involves motivic structure, and will be discussed below.
