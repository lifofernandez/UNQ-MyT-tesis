Now turn to the first half of passage 4.41. The musical surface appar-
ently provides no new applications of preference rules, but a considera-
tion of the time-span reduction reveals evidence for metrical structure.
The issue concerns where the harmony is heard to change in each group.
As pointed out already, each chord is immediately preceded by a pitch
that is consistent with it, so the chords are not heard as the points of
change. However, example 4.42, the time-span reduction of beats 1-24
at the quarter-note level, shows pitches inconsistent with the preceding
harmony at 10, 16, and 22, suggesting that these beats are the point of
harmonic change; we have indicated this in 4.41.8

As evidence that this indirect source of metrical prominence derived
through the time-span reduction is the correct one, consider 4.43, in
which the pitches at $ and 11 have been changed from Haydn's.

Whatever the musical sins of this alteration, it results in a radically differ-
ent metrical intuitionâ€” the strongest beats are most naturally heard at 6
and 12 rather than at 4 and 10. The theory proposed here accounts nicely
for this difference: because the chords in 4.43 are not preceded by pitches
consistent with them, they can this time be heard as the points of har-
monic change. Hence 6 and 12 rather than 4 and 10 will be marked by
MPRs Se and Sf, altering the distribution of metrical weight.

In choosing the preferred dotted half-note level for this part of 4.41, we
are faced with a conflict between the harmonic changes at 4, 10, 16, and
22 on one hand and the chords at 6, 12, 18, and 24 on the other. Though
the strength of the harmony rule (MPR Sf) is undoubtedly sufficient to
prevail, the metrical evidence for the chords causes them to be heard as
cross-accents, parallel to those in the second half of the passage at 30 and
36

Thus the rules predict that the analysis shown in 4.41 should be fa-
vored for both halves of the passage. However, the indirectness of metri-
cal evidence in the first half of the passage and the syncopation in the
