General Considerations

As in the case of the time-span reduction, the procedure for determining
the most stable prolongational reduction involves constructing the tree
piecemeal and finding the most important event in each of the many
hierarchically related regions of the piece. The regions of application for
time-span reduction were the time-spans, independently determined on
the basis of the grouping and metrical structure. However, this is not the
case for prolongational reduction; as was pointed out in sections 5.4
and 8.3, it is characteristic of prolongational reduction that its regions
cut across group boundaries. This means that the regions for rule appli-
cation cannot be fixed in terms of information available from other com-
ponents.

Prolongational Hypothesis 1 suggests the overall principle by which
regions of rule application are determined for the prolongational reduc-
tion. This hypothesis implies that the function of an event in building or
releasing tension depends on its relationship to surrounding events that
are prolongationally more important: its role consists of a step in pro-
gressing from one of these surrounding events to the other.

This conclusion in turn leads to a radical difference between the con-
struction of the prolongational tree and the other three components of
the analysis. Whereas the grouping, metrical, and time-span structures
were built from the smallest units up, culminating with the largest ele-
ments of the structure, the prolongational structure must be constructed
from the top down, starting with the head of the piece and dividing the
piece into progressively smaller regions until all events are included. This
method is necessary because the prolongational context in which an
event e is heard depends on the position and relationships of events that
are prolongationally more important than e.

The Prolongational Head

In order to construct the tree from the top down, we must start by finding
the prolongational head of the piece. Prolongational Hypothesis 2 says
that prolongational importance is in large part tied to time-span impor-
tance. This suggests that we begin by identifying the prolongational head
with the time-span head of the piece. In other words, the point of maxi-
mal prolongational stability—the point of greatest relaxation—is that
point in the piece that most strongly articulates the end of the largest
group. (In the next section this claim will be incorporated into a prefer-
ence rule, but for the moment let us just take it for granted.)

The prolongational head is not necessarily the absolute end of the
piece, since in some cases a coda may be subordinate in the time-span
reduction to the full cadence that precedes it. This occurred in the Cho-
rale St. Antoni, discussed in section 8.5. In such cases the end of the coda
usually forms a strong prolongation with the prolongational head, so
that the very end of the piece is equally a point of maximal relaxation.
