Of the two choices presented below it, 7.16b is intuitively the more
natural. Because the heads in 7.16b fall on beats at the quarter-note level
and those in 7.16c fall on beats only at the eighth-note level, this example
suggests the following preference rule:

TSRPR 1 (Metrical Position) Of the possible choices for head of a time-
span T, prefer a choice that is in a relatively strong metrical position.

A second principle involves pitch stability. Section 6.2 discussed the
treatment of local dissonances: an ordinary passing or neighboring tone
1s subordinate to the preceding note, whereas a suspension or appoggia-
tura is subordinate to its resolution. The principle behind these choices is
that a consonant vertical configuration must be chosen as head in prefer-
ence to a dissonant one, regardless of metrical weight. In the case of a
passing tone, which falls in weak metrical position, this choice reinforces
the preference of TSRPR 1 for strong metrical position. By contrast, an
appoggiatura is in strong metrical position and its resolution is in a weak
position; the resulting conflict berween harmonic and rhythmic principles
is what creates the expressive force of the appoggiatura. This principle
filters out most of the absolute dissonances in a musical surface within
one or two stages of reduction. But an extension of the principle to
include relative degrees of consonance and dissonance allows it to oper-
ate at larger levels, and expands its application at smaller ones.

If we are to state this principle fully, the theory must include a defini-
tion of the relative degrees of consonance and dissonance of all possible
vertical configurations. These are well known from traditional theory
and will simply be assumed here. It only needs to be pointed out that
there are two distinct measures of vertical consonance and dissonance.
The first is the intrinsic consonance of the pitch-event itself. According to
this criterion, major and minor triads in root position are the most stable,
followed by their first inversions. The second inversion is dissonant, be-
cause of the fourth between the bass and another part; likewise,
seventh chords are dissonant and require resolution. But, in addition,
a pitch-event has a stability relative to the local tonic, measured
essentially in terms of closeness on the circle of fifths, with additional
