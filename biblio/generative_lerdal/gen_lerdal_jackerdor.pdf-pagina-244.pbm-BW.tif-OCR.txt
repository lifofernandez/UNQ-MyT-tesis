Normative Structure and Musical Complexity

Why should musical grammar include such a rule as PRPR 6? To convey
the effect of the rule in a more general context, we observe that all the
previous rules of time-span and prolongational reduction consider as
maximally stable those structures in which virtually nothing happens. E
piece were to consist entirely of tonic chords and full cadences, these
other rules for pitch organization would be blissfully happy, since there
would be little if any conflict in pitch stability. Obviously, from the point
of view of musical interest, such a piece would be unsatisfactory; some-
thing must happen. Consider, for example, what the Chopin A Major
Prelude would sound like with V—I progressions throughout.

But simply to say that music must deviate somehow from total regular-
ity would leave the shape of pieces virtually unconstrained. PRPR 6
addresses this problem. It requires that a piece have prolongational vari-
ety, so that a passage of total stasis (except to confirm a phrase ending) is
heard as unusual. But the rule further says that not just any variety is
desirable; the variety must be manifested as structured patterns of ten-
sion and relaxation. Since the constraint is stated in terms of types of
connections among events, and since it is to an extent independent of
surface rhythmic considerations, it leaves the composer free to satisfy it in
innumerable interesting ways. And insofar as the rule applies to ca-
denced groups hierarchically from the phrase level up to the entire piece,
its multilayered effects create pressure toward a musical surface of con-
siderable complexity—and toward a complexity that increases with the
size of the piece.
