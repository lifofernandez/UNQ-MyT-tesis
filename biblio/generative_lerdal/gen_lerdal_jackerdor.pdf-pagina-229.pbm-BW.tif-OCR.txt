4. (Harmonic condition)

a. (Distance) A connection between two events is harmonically more
stable if their roots are closer on the circle of fifths.

b. (Direction) A progression that ascends along the circle of fifths is
most stable as a right-branching structure; one that descends along
the circle of fifths or produces a subdominant-to-dominant relation-
ship is most stable as a left-branching structure.

Condition 1 was discussed in connection with examples 8.5 and 8.6
and requires no further exposition here. Condition 2 was illustrated by a
secondary dominant relationship in 8.10e. More broadly, this condition
applies not just to local borrowing from other diatonic collections but
also to tonicizations at various larger levels of structure. For example,
this condition creates pressure to unify the branchings in the dominant
region of a sonata movement.

Condition 3a was illustrated in examples 8.10a and 8.10b and needs
no more comment. Condition 3b expresses the commonplace intuition
that a singer or a trumpeter, for example, must make a greater effort to
reach higher pitches; hence ascent and descent correspond to tension and
relaxation respectively. The Schenkerian Urlinie, a descending stepwise
melodic progression, reflects both conditions 3a and 3b.

Parallel to the distance and direction aspects of melodic connection,
there are corresponding distance and direction aspects of harmonic
connection. Condition 4a was illustrated in examples 8.10c and 8.10d;
condition 4b in 8.18 and 8.19,

Condition 4a does not mention relative and parallel major-minor rela-
tionships, because they arise from the interaction of condition 4a with
condition 2. The relative major-minor relationship is fairly distant on the
circle of fifths but close in diatonic collection; conversely, the parallel
major-minor relationship is identical on the circle of fifths but dissimilar
in diatonic connection. Thus major-minor relationships are more equiv-
ocal than tonic-dominant relationships, where conditions 2 and 4a are Ã­n
mutual agreement.

The ways in which conditions 3 and 4 reinforce or conflict are an
enriching factor in the tonal idiom. For example, the harmonic implica-
tions of even an unaccompanied melody often override purely melodic
factors in determining prolongational connection. Conversely, a har-
monic progression as such also produces melodic implications, especially
through the motion of the bass. Typically, melodic influences are more
marked at smaller levels of reduction, and at larger levels play a relatively
insignificant role in comparison with harmonic connection.

The interaction of conditions 1-4 and their refinement could be pur-
sued further, but we will not do so here. In the present context these
conditions act as sub-preference rules within the application of PRPR 3,
much like the subcases of the local-detail rules in grouping (GPRs 2 and 3)
