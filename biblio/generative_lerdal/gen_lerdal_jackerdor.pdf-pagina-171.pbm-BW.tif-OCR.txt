connection, the choice of prolongational reduction will be conflicted. It
seems conceivable, therefore, that the influence of linear and especially
harmonic connection on time-span reduction should not be stated di-
rectly in the TSRPRs, but rather it arises through the effect of time-span
reduction on the stability of the prolongational reduction. This solution
can be expressed in the theory by replacing TSRPRs 6a and 6b with the
following rule:

TSRPR 6 (Prolongational Stability) In choosing the head of a time-span
T, prefer a choice that results in more stable choice of prolongational
reduction.

Note the similarity berween this and TSRPR 5. These rules encode the
interdependence of the different components of musical cognition on
each other. It is the feedback among the various components that makes
it so difficult to isolate these principles.

TSRPR 6 is crucially involved in the choice of fusion or transformation
rather than ordinary reduction for a time-span. For example, in the Bach
Cello Suite quoted in 7.10-—7.12, fusion is plausible in part because it
results in a consistent multivoiced texture that follows principles of good
voice leading and harmonic progression. (In addition, fusion is favored
by relatively great distance berween the two lines and by relatively rapid
alternation berween them; these factors are intuitively relevant, but we
have for the moment not formalized them.) Similarly, in the passage from
“O Haupt” quoted in 7.13, transformation is necessary because neither
of the choices available through ordinary reduction produces a good
progression in the next level of reduction. Thus, although we have no
complete account of how fusion and transformation are chosen, TSRPR 6
provides a starting point for such a study.

Retention of Cadences

The preference rules stated so far make two errors in their treatment of
cadences. First, the rules provide no way to choose a two-element ca-
dence as head of a time-span, since they all deal with ordinary reduction.
Second, as pointed out in section 6.3, the rules of rhythmic and harmonic
stability (TSRPRs 1 and 2) often lead to incorrect choices where half
cadences are involved. For example, in measure 4 of K. 331 (see 7.20a),
the rules so far say unequivocally that the I rather than the cadential V
should be chosen as head for the measure. Both of these failings of the
rules motivate an additional preference rule:

TSRPR 7 (Cadential Retention, preliminary form) Of the possible
choices for head of a time-span T, strongly prefer an event or pair of
events that forms a cadence.
