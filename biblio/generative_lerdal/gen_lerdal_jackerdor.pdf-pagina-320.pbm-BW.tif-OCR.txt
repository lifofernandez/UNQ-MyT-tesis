Which in turn was greater than [3 stress], and so forth. In addition, all
numbered degrees were treated as greater in stress than [unstressed]. To
employ this formalism in rules, elaborate conventions had to be devel-
oped that had little to do with the linguistic insight they were intended to
express. In the tree notation, by contrast, main stress falls on the syllable
dominated only by ss in the tree (the designated terminal element), sub-
sidiary stresses fall on syllables immediately dominated by s, and un-
stressed syllables are all inmediately dominated by w. In reconciliation,
for instance, the main stress falls on the penultimate syllable, subsidiary
stresses fall on re- and -cil-, and the remaining syllables are unstressed; in
contractual, only the single syllable -trac- is stressed. Thus the tree nota-
tion represents relative stress as explicitly relational; that is, in terms of
hierarchical oppositions of ss and uws. For many reasons this is clearly
superior to the theory that assigns stress in terms of numerical values;
and for once a major change in linguistic theory has not met with vocif-
erous opposition.

We can now make an initial comparison of time-span reduction and
prosodic structure. Abstracting away from the musical and linguistic
material at the botroms of the trees, let us examine the trees themselves.
In both sorts of trees, each branch divides into branches that are classified
according to a binary opposition. In the time-span-reduction tree, the
opposition is head versus elaboration; in the prosodic tree, the opposi-
tion is strong versus weak.* This similarity leads to the observation that
the two tree notations are essentially notational variants. Taking the
time-span reduction notion of head as parallel to the prosodic notion of
strong, we can establish the equivalence of structures shown in 12.10.

With this equivalence, we can convert a prosodic tree into time-span
reduction notation by systematically substituting time-span configura-
tions for the corresponding prosodic ones at each node in the tree; thatis,
a right branching for an s-1 configuration and a left branching for a 1w-s,
Alternatively, we can convert time-span reductions into prosodic nota-
tion by reversing the process. Figure 12.11 is the time-span notation
corresponding to the analyses of reconciliation and contractual given in
12.9. It can readily be seen that Liberman and Prince's notion of desig-
nated terminal element (that unit dominated only by ss in a tree) trans-
lates into time-span notation as the head (that unit from which all others
