The Reduction Hypothesis and the Tree Notation

Chapters $5 and 6 have developed many of the ideas we need to state the
well-formedness rules for time-span reduction. The most basic is that
every time-span has a most important event, or head, selected from the
pitch-events in it; the other pitch-events are said to be subordinate to the
head.

Chapter $ also presented what we called the Strong Reduction Hy-
pothesis, namely that all the pitch-events of a piece can be organized into
a single structure by hierarchical relationships of subordination. It is
essential to this hypothesis that the relationship of subordination be tran-
sitive; that is, if pitch-event x is subordinate to pitch-event y, and y is
subordinate to , then x is subordinate to z. More intuitively, if a partic-
ular event is the structurally most important event of some large time-
span, then it must also be the structurally most important event of all
smaller time-spans to which it belongs. Were this not the case, a strictly
ordered hierarchy would be impossible; for example, an event could be
subordinate to itself.

In turn, the transitivity of subordination enables us to represent all
levels of time-span reduction of a piece perspicuously in the tree notation
introduced in chapter 5. Each pitch-event in the piece is connected to a
branch of the tree; each branch but the longest terminates on another
branch. Termination of a branch b, on another branch b, signifies that
there is a step of time-span reduction in which the pitch-event e,
connected to b, is eliminated in favor of the pitch-event e, connected to
b>. In this situation we will say that e, is directly subordinate to e. In
addition, because of the transitivity of subordination, e, is subordinate to
all the pitch-events to which e; is subordinate; these can be found by
tracing upward in the tree to the termination of branch b, on another
branch b3, and so on to the top of the tree.

Thus the tree notation is possible only if subordination is transitive. 1f
the Strong Reduction Hypothesis turns out to be false, the notation for
reduction will have to be modified accordingly. On the other hand, we
find it difficult to envision a theory lacking the Strong Reduction Hy-
pothesis that would be both sufficiently rich and sufficiently constrained
to constitute a plausible account of musical cognition.

We sum up this discussion by giving a preliminary statement of the
well-formedness rules. One definition will make the rules clearer, We will
say that a time-span T; immediately contains another time-span T; if T,
contains T; and if there is no time-span Ty such that 7; contains Ty and TÂ»
contains T;. Informally, T; inmediately contains 7; when 7; is exactly one
level smaller than 7;.

TSRWER 1 For every time-span T, there is an event e that is the head of
T; all other events in T are subordinate to e. .
