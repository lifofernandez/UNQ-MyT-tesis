second half together create an overall complexity in deriving the pre-
ferred metrical interpretation, and this seems to reflect accurately the
complexity that this passage presents to musical intuition.

By contrast, the Mozart example 4.35 provides clear evidence for a
metrical interpretation at every level and at nearly every point in the
passage; applications of metrical rules are numerous and mutually rein-
forcing. The nature of the derivation predicts that the passage will be
heard as metrically straightforward, in accordance with intuition. Thus
we have seen how the preference-rule formalism not only can derive a
final analysis for a passage, but can also express finer intuitions about the
degree of metrical complexity and the reasons it arises. This is one of the
ways in which the theory bridges the gap between artistic and psycho-
logical concerns, one of the principal goals of the present study.

With one exception, to appear in the next section, this completes our
discussion of metrical preference rules. To sum up: The preference rules
decide which of the many possible well-formed metrical structures as-
signable to a piece represents its intuitively preferred metrical interpre-
tation. The rules of local detail—MPRs 3 (event), 4 (stress), and 5
(length) —are supplemented by considerations having to do with stability
of the bass (MPR 6), of cadences (MPR 7), and of suspensions (MPR 8). In
addition, interaction with grouping structure (MPR 2) and time-span
reduction (MPR 9) and the ubiquitous and powerful considerations of
parallelism (MPR 1) affect the choice of metrical structure.

There is reason to believe that much of this preference-rule system is
not peculiar to classical Western tonal music, but is universal. The rules
of local detail seem to us especially strong candidates. We should make
clear what such a claim of universality means. Take the rule of local
stress, for example. There are of course musical idioms in which local
stresses do not appear; Renaissance choral music for instance can argu-
ably be said not to have them. But we would feel fairly confident in
conjecturing that there is no musical idiom employing stress in which it
does not mark potential metrical strength. In this sense we can say that
the preference rule for stress is always available to musical intuition; the
differences berween idioms in this respect lie only in whether they ever
give the rule opportunities to apply.

We conclude this chapter by returning to metrical well-formedness
rules, briefly discussing two topics: well-formedness rules for other met-
rical traditions, and metrical irregularities.

In section 2.2 we observed that, unlike the grouping well-formedness
rules, which appear to be essentially universal across musical idioms, the
metrical rules are in part idiom-specific. This section will illustrate some
possible variants of the rules that lead to metrical idioms other than that
of classical Western tonal music.
