In such cases we can speak of the grouping and metrical structures as in
phase. An example is the Beethoven scherzo in 2.15. However, if a group
begins on a beat weaker than the strongest beat in the group (thatiis, ¡f it
begins on an upbeat), then the grouping and metrical structures are out
of phase—that is, the grouping boundaries cut across the periodicity of
the metrical grid, as in 2.17b.

Grouping and meter can be in or out of phase in varying degrees. To
clarify this point, we define anacrusis as the span from the beginning of a
group to the strongest beat in the group. (The term upbeat will not do
here, since beats do not have duration; an anacrusis can include many
upbeats at various levels.) If the anacrusis is brief, as in the Haydn minuet
(2.12), grouping and meter are only slightly out of phase. On the other
hand, if the anacrusis takes up a major portion of the relevant group, as
in the theme of the G Minor Symphony (2.14), grouping and meter are
acutely out of phase. Acutely out-of-phase passages are more compli-
cated for the listener to process because the recurrent patterns in the two
components conflict rather than reinforce one another. Generally, the
degree to which grouping and meter are in or out of phase is a highly
important rhythmic feature of a musical passage.

Unlike metrical structure, pitch structure is a powerful organizing force
at global levels of musical structure. The launching of a section, the
return of a tonal region, or the articulation of a cadence can all have
large-scale reverberations. Pitch-events functioning at such levels cause
“structural accents” because they are the pillars of tonal organization, its
“points of gravity.” In Cone's simile (1968, pp. 26-27), a ball is thrown,
soars through the air, and is caught; likewise, events causing structural
accents initiate and terminate arcs of tonal motion. The initiating event
can be called a structural beginning, and the terminating event a struc-
tural ending or cadence. (Chapter 6 will show how these events emerge
from time-span reduction.)

The relation of structural accent to grouping is easily disposed of:
Structural accents articulate the boundaries of groups at the phrase level
and all larger grouping levels. To be sure, a structural beginning may
occur shortly after the onset of a group, especially if there is an anacrusis;
more rarely, an extension after a cadence may cause a group to stretch
beyond the cadence proper. In general, however, these events form an arc
