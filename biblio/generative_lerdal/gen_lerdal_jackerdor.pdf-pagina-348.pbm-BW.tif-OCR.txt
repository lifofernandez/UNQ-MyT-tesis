13. For what it is worth, Kiparsky 1977 shows that so-called triple merers in
poetry (dactylic and anapestic) must be treated as duple merters with a divided
weak position. The consequences of this for music are unclear.

14. In this we agree with Liberman (1975, pp. 313—314), who, after demon-
strating the importance of metrical structure (in our terms) to language, makes
the following observarion:

There is some reason (evolutionary parsimony, if nothing else) to suppose that the cases of
language, music, and dance demonstrate, in a more intuitively accessible way, a system
Which in fact is the organizing principle of all temporally ordered behavior. . .. [This sup-
position] suggests that the source and origin of “rhythm” is quite abstract, especially with
respect to the fundamental division berween event-structure [our time-span structure] and
time-structure [our metrical structure]. ...

It is worth pointing out that this tremendously advantageous system does seem to impose
one requirement—thar the behavior in question be abstractly segmented into discrete sub-
units. An interesting consequence of this is that there could be no music without notes
(structured, say, [into continuous contours]), no language without words and phonemes (in
which the meaningful units were irretrievably smeared throughout a temporally unseg-
mented noise), and no dance without “steps.”
