structure in terms of principles that account for simpler musical phenom-
ena. The insights of an “artistic” approach can thus be incorporated into
a larger and more explanatory framework.?

We will now elaborate the notion of “the musical intuitions of the
experienced listener.” By this we mean not just his conscious grasp of
musical structure; an acculturated listener need never have studied music.
Rather we are referring to the largely unconscious knowledge (the “mu-
sical intuition”) that the listener brings to his hearing—a knowledge
that enables him to organize and make coherent the surface patterns of
pitch, attack, duration, intensity, timbre, and so forth. Such a listener is
able to identify a previously unknown piece as an example of the idiom,
to recognize elements of a piece as typical or anomalous, to identify a
performer's error as possibly producing an “ungrammatical” configura-
tion, to recognize various kinds of structural repetitions and variations,
and, generally, to comprehend a piece within the idiom.

A listener without sufficient exposure to an idiom will not be able to
organize in any rich way the sounds he perceives. However, once he
becomes familiar with the idiom, the kind of organization that he attrib-
utes to a given piece will not be arbitrary but will be highly constrained in
specific ways. In our view a theory of a musical idiom should characterize
such organization in terms of an explicit formal musical grammar that
models the listener's connection berween the presented musical surface of
a piece and the structure he attributes to the piece. Such a grammar
comprises a system of rules that assigns analyses to pieces. This contrasts
with previous approaches, which have left it to the analyst's judgment to
decide how to fit theoretical constructs to a particular piece.

The “experienced listener” is meant as an idealization. Rarely do two
people hear a given piece in precisely the same way or with the same
degree of richness. Nonetheless, there is normally considerable agreement
on what are the most natural ways to hear a piece. A theory of a musical
idiom should be concerned above all with those musical judgments for
Which there is substantial interpersonal agreement. But it also should
characterize situations in which there are alternative interpretations, and
it should have the scope to permit discussion of the relative merits of
variant readings.

The concept of the “experienced listener,” of course, is no more than a
convenient delimitation. Occasionally we will refer to the intuitions of a
less sophisticated listener, who uses the same principles as the experi-
enced listener in organizing his hearing of music, but in a more limited
way. In dealing with especially complex artistic issues, we will sometimes
elevate the experienced listener to the status of a “perfect” listener—that
privileged being whom the great composers and theorists presumably
aspire to address.

It is useful to make a second idealization about the listener's intuition.
Instead of describing the listener's real-time mental processes, we will be
