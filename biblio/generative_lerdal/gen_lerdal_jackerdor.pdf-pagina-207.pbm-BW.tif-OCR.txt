A Complete
Prolongational
Reduction

The secondary notation visually conveys the linear dimension of pro-
longational reduction better than does the tree (a matter of appearance,
not substance), and it easily conveys the “prolongational groupings”
inherent in prolongational reduction. On the other hand, it does not
distinguish between weak prolongation and progression. More impor-
tant, it is less clear than the tree concerning domination and subordina-
tion, and it says nothing about tension and relaxation.

In closing the description of prolongational notation, we observe that
there is no labeling of levels in either the prolongational tree or its sec-
ondary notation. As discussed in section 6.2, such labeling is meaningful
in time-span reduction only because time-spans tend to be fairly regular
in duration. No such situation obtains in prolongational reduction. What
counts here is the patterns of connection and subordination; these rela-
tionships produce the patterns of tension and relaxation. The relative
significance of an event is a function of its degree of embedding in the
overall structure. For example, in 8.31b the vii5 in both phrases is deeply
embedded, while the final ii5—V progression is directly subordinate to the
most important event in the passage, the final I. The geometric height of a
branch is immaterial.

This section will present the prolongational reduction of a more extended
excerpt, the Chorale St. Antoni (formerly attributed to Haydn) as ar-
ranged by Brahms in his Haydn Variations, op. S56b (example 8.32). To
put the analysis in context, we begin with the grouping, metrical, and
time-span analyses of the theme (8.33). For convenience, the music in
8.33 simplifies the registers from 8.32, and already represents the
quarter-note level of time-span reduction plus only those events at the
eighth-note level that form separate harmonies. In addition, the grouping
