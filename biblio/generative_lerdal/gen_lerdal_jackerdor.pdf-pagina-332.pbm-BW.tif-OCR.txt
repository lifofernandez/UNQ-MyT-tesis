Here it is not clear to us which theory should give way, or even if either
should. On one hand there seems to be only one use in prosodic theory
for recursive binary-branching trees that cannot be equally coded into
multiply branching trees: the assignment of relative degree of subsidiary
stress (Liberman and Prince 1977, p. 259), which is certainly an impor-
tant function. But in sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the paper Liberman and
Prince suggest that subsidiary stresses are assigned by reference to the
metrical structure instead (or in addition). Thus the restriction of pro-
sodic segmentation and trees to strictly binary branching does not have as
much explanatory value as might be expected.

On the other hand, there is some potential justification for strict binary
branching in time-span trees. At subgroup levels, where ternary branch-
ing occurs in connection with ternary meter, there is often motivation for
an additional segmentation into 2 + 1 (d J)or1+2(J) ) (the
typical “oom-pah-pah” accompaniment can be thought of as a special
case of the latter). Although this subgrouping would not be adhered to
consistently throughout a piece, as the meter is, it could be supplied in
each ternary subgroup by appropriately stated preference rules for time-
span segmentation, a rule type we have so far managed to avoid.

At larger levels, intuirion seems to support the grouping of multiply
branching forms such as variations by twos, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary. An odd variation at the end would be adjoined to the group
consisting of the previous two variations—oparallel to the segmentation
of trisyllabic feet in English. Thus there might be some advantage to
imposing strict binary branching on time-span reductions.13 Whatever
the outcome, the discrepancy between prosodic and time-span theory
does not seem irreconcilable, or even particularly serious.

A much more important difference is in the interpretation of time-span
and prosodic trees. As observed above, a branch at any level of a time-
span tree stands for a single pitch-event, which is elaborated by all the
events whose branches are subsidiary to it. In a prosodic tree, however, a
branch is taken to stand for an entire prosodic constituent containing
strong and weak parts, If the trees are interpreted so differently, can the
theories really be parallel?

The contrast between the two interpretations is not unlike that be-
tween two interpretations of metrical accent in music itself. One view,
that of Cooper and Meyer 1960, is that metrical weight is (in our terms) a
property of time-spans—that metrical weight has duration. In section
2.3 we argued against such a view and for one in which metrical weight is
a property of beats (points in time) rather than time-spans. We said there,
essentially, that subsidiary elements of “strong” time-spans (time-spans
beginning on a relatively strong beat) are in fact no stronger than sub-
sidiary weak elements of “weak” time-spans. For example, in a 4/4 mea-
sure, the second beat does not receive more weight than the fourth by
