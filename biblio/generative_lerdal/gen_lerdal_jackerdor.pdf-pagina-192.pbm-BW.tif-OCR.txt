starting from its largest, most important levels. If it were the other way
around, the time-span importance of an event could not be evaluated at
any particular stage of analysis.

We do not argue that prolongational importance necessarily corre-
sponds in a one-to-one relationship with time-span importance. Nor does
time-span importance dictate the actual prolongational connections.
Rather, time-span importance acts as the general regulator of events
available for successive levels of prolongational analysis. From this input
the optimal prolongational connections can be established.

The close dependence of prolongational reduction on time-span reduc-
tion constitutes a major claim of our theory. It asserts that the perceived
patterns of tension and relaxation in pitch structure depend crucially on
the hierarchy of structurally important events within time-spans as de-
fined by meter and grouping. In other words, the listener's understanding
of pitch connections in a piece is a function of how he segments its
surface. This claim entails the unification of pitch and rhythm within one
overarching theory.

A detailed explanation of prolongational importance andiits relation to
time-span importance presupposes an understanding of prolonga-
tional domains, a full discussion of which is postponed until section 9.3.
We have outlined this relationship here only in order to convey a frame-
work within which prolongational trees can be understood intuitively.

Our course in this section will be initially to consider the most global
level of a piece, since prolongational reduction proceeds from global to
local levels. From this immediately emerges the conception of the pro-
longational basic form (corresponding to the Schenkerian Ursatz), which
we then utilize to develop a prolongational structure for antecedent-
consequent periods. Narrowing our focus further, we next investigate
cadential preparations and some characteristic patterns within the single
phrase. Then we show how the tree for a phrase can change, depending
on whether the phrase is analyzed in isolation or as part of a larger
context. Finally, we draw an important generalization about prolonga-
tional trees.

The Basic Form and the Antecedent-Consequent Period

The most global levels of time-span reduction typically yield the structure
shown in 8.13a. These events are the first to become available for prolon-
gational analysis. As the prolongational tree in 8.13b shows, the opening
[ attaches as a weak prolongation to the final T, after which the structural
dominant attaches as a resolving left branch to the final I. This V must be
a left branch because it is part of the cadence and because the final I is the
dominating event in its environment at this stage of analysis.
