the V-vi forms a deceptive cadence at the end of a phrase, and the
following progression is a phrase extension that forms a group of its own.

In time-span reduction the vi is more important than the preceding V,
since it forms the rhythmic completion of the group. However, in prolon-
gational reduction the V will normally be more important, for reasons of
harmonic stability. The problem PRPR 2 addresses is how to attach the vi
chord.

At the point in the derivation where the attachment of the vi is being
considered, its context is the V on the left and the ii“ on the right. A
harmonic connection in either direction is possible: the vi can in principle
be construed either as a departure from the preceding V or as part of the
cadential preparation for the final V. PRPR 2, taking note that the first V
and the vi are contained in a group that does not contain the ii“, tips the
balance in favor of the right-branching interpretation (departure). In the
resulting tree the branching is not congruent with the time-span branch-
ing, but it does respect grouping boundaries. PRPR 2 is stated in terms of
segmentation rather than branching, then, in order to address just this
sort of case.

PRPR 2 is by no means as strong a rule as PRPR 1, since prolongational
reductions commonly are noncongruent with time-span segmentation. Its
influence appears to be strongest at relatively local levels of segmentation
and to fade considerably from the phrase level up. The local strength of
PRPR 2 seems to be related to the “locality” condition on fusion in
time-span reduction (mentioned in section 7.2), in ways that we cannot at
present specify.

If unchecked by other considerations, PRPR 2 would build prolonga-
tional trees that expressed tension and relaxation only in terms of each
individual phrase, connecting the phrases up in whatever manner the
time-span segmentation dictated. Thus PRPR 2 creates pressure toward
relatively local, phrase-by-phrase prolongational reductions of the sort
