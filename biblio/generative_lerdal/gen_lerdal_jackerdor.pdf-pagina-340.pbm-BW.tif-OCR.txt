11. Schenker's brief remarks about pirch-metrical relations (1935, especially
paragraph 288) are consonant with the views set forth here. Also see his rhythmic
analysis of the first movement of Beerhoven's Fifth Symphony (1921, pp. 27—37).
On the other hand, no clear distincrion is made between grouping and meter.

1. In this and succeeding examples, we include the rest berween groups as part of
the earlier group. This is not just a convention, bur corresponds to the intuition
thar a group normally begins with irs first note. To make the intuition clearer,
consider a case like measures 124—127 of the Eroica Symphony, where one
clearly has the opposite sense: the rests on the downbears of these measures are
heard as part of a group that includes the two following beats. Such a striking
exception makes the intuition in the normal case more evident by contrast. Ap-
parently, then, the assignment of rests to groups is rule-governed. However, we
will nor pursue the details of this phenomenon here.

2. The term preference rule should not mislead the reader into thinking that
preference rules model conscious preferences. Much of musical understanding 1s
unconscious and hence seems automatic. A “preferred” analysis represents how a
musical passage is coherent to a listener.

Proximity and similarity are of course only two of many principles involved in
visual and auditory perception. Another well-known principle is good continua-
tion, one musical analog of which is the rule of prolongational connection
(PRPR 3) in prolongational reduction. This rule picks out as strucrurally impor-
rant chose events that form the best connection with (are the best continuation of)
surrounding structurally important events.

3. Tenney and Polansky (1980) develop a theory of “temporal gestalt-units” that
corresponds in some respects to our theory of grouping preference rules. Their
system includes an equivalent of GPR 1, rhough they make the rule a prohibition
of single-element groups rather than an avoidance. They have a rule of proximity
thar is in essential respects idenrical to our attack-point rule (GPR 2b), and a rule
of similarity that is close to our register and dynamics rules (GPRs 3a and 3b).
Furthermore, they make clear that grouping perception relies on the interaction
of the various principles. Their treatment attempts more than ours in one respect:
they quantify strengths of rule application, so thar grouping judgments can be
simulated by a computer program. The reasons we have nor taken this step are
explained later in this section.

1. See Cone's (1968) remarks on differences in importance of hypermeasure levels
through the history of classical Western tonal music.

2. Metrical preference rule 2, the “downbeat early” rule, predicrs in addirion that
structure ¿, with the strong beat on the first nore of each group, should be slightly
more natural than structure //. This seems to conform to intuirion. However, if
the second eighth note and the rest are replaced by a quarter nore, structure íí is
considerably more natural than ¿. We take up this effect in the next subsection. A
similar situation occurs in 4.17a below.

3. Because of their similarity, it would be possible to generalize MPRs 3 and 4 into
a single rule. We keep them separate only for convenience.

4. Though the use of the time-span reduction in 4.32 1s clear, we have not
gathered definitive evidence for what in general constitures a “relevant” level of
time-span reduction for the length rule. We believe thar the rule may use any
rime-span level that is smaller than the metrical level currently being derived.
