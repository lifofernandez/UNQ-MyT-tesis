Metrical Deletion, second version Given a well-formed metrical struc-
ture M in which
i. B,, Bs, and B3 are adjacent beats of M at level L;, and Byis also a beat
at level L;,,,
il. T, is the time-span from B, to B; and Tz is the time-span from B to
Bs, and
ili. M is associated with an underlying grouping structure G in such a
way that both T, and T; are related to a surface time-span T' by the
grouping transformation performed on G of
(a) left elision or
(b) overlap,
then a well-formed metrical structure M' can be formed from M and
associated with the surface grouping structure by
(a) deleting B, and all beats at all levels berween B, and B>,, and
associating B, with the onset of T”, or
(b) deleting B, and all beats at all levels berween B; and B:, and
associating B, with the onset of T”.

As in the case of grouping overlaps and elisions, we will not explore the
preference-rule mechanisms involved in detecting the presence of metrical
deletions. However, 1f they are linked as closely to grouping as we be-
lieve, and if the presence of cadences is as crucial to grouping overlap and
elision as has been suggested in section 3.4, then it becomes clearer how a
powerful confluence of factors can accumulate in the musical surface to
break the established pattern. We leave for future research the incor-
poration of these observations into the formal system.
