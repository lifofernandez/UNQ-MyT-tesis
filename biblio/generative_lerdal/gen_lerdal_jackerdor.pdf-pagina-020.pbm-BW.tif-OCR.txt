of this uniformity from level to level, we can assert that grouping struc-
ture is recursive; that is, it can be elaborated indefinitely by the same
rules.

The second point follows from the nonoverlapping condition for
hierarchical structures: nonadjacent units cannot group together at any
particular level of analysis. To see what this means, consider the sequence
in 2.4. On the basis of identity, one might wish to group all the as
together and all the bs together (2.4a). Although such a grouping is
conceivable in principle, it is not the kind of grouping structure intended
here. Translated into the slur notation, 2.4a would yield the impermissi-
ble overlaps in2.4b (in which, as a visual convenience, the as are grouped
by dashed slurs and the bs by solid slurs). The correct grouping analysis
of this sequence is instead 2.4c, which captures the larger repetition of the
aab pattern.

The Beethoven scherzo of 2.3 (repeated in 2.5) provides an approxi-
mate analog to 2.4 if we consider it (plausibly enough) to consist of three
motivic cells: the 16th-note arpeggio (a), the single chord (b), and the
cadential figure (c). Linking these cells together produces some structure
such as that indicated in 2.5. Although the listener undoubtedly makes
such associations, they are not the grouping structure that he hears.
Rather he hears the grouping in 2.3a, in which the motivic cells are
related to their surrounding contexts and parallel motivic cells form par-
allel parts of groups.
