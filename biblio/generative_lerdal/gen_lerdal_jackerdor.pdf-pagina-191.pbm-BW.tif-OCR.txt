section of an ABA form (8.12c). At these global levels right-branching
neighboring motion is particularly obvious: one hears the contrasting
section in relation to what has happened, not to what is yet to come. On
the other hand, when elaborating a local prolongational anticipation, the
result may be left-branching neighboring motion, as in 8.12d.

The factors determining right or left branching may, of course, conflict
with one another—as, for instance, when melodic and harmonic influ-
ences are in opposition. And more factors enter into right and left
branching than we have so far discussed. What this account has estab-
lished is that in all cases there are intuitions concerning right versus left
branching, and consequently that mere “in-between-ness” is not a suf-
ficient analytic concept.

We must cover one other issue before building trees. What in general
makes one event prolongationally more important than another? For
example, how did it come about in 89 that y was lower in the tree than x
or 2? Observe that this is in principle a different question than what we
have just been addressing. Up to this point we have been concerned with
the mode of connection among events already available for analysis.
Now we ask why it is these events that are available in the first place.

One might suppose that absolute criteria of pitch stability provide a
hierarchical scale by which prolongational importance can be gauged.
But, as we saw in section 5.4, this scale is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for prolongational analysis. Rhythmic factors also play a vital
role in the perception of prolongational relationships. Specifically,
rhythmically unimportant events are heard as prolongationally relatively
unimportant, and structural accents are heard as prolongationally rela-
tively important, regardless of absolute criteria of pitch stability. These
perceptions can be reflected in the prolongational tree if the prolonga-
tional reduction derives not from the musical surface but from its asso-
ciated time-span reduction, since, in addition to reflecting factors of pitch
stability, the latter contains the requisite rhythmic information. The
time-span importance of an event thus becomes a governing factor in
determining its prolongational importance. From this it follows that,
unlike the other components, the prolongational tree must be constructed
