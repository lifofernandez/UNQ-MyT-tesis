metrical structure), but in the grouping it belongs to measure 13 (as an
anticipation of the next phrase).

 

Although such an interpretation may shed light on the unique tension of
this moment in the theme, it will not do as a procedure for constructing
reductions.The Strong Reduction Hypothesis requires that the Ft on the
fourth beat of measure 12 cannot attach both ways at once. This moment
is an isolated instance in this particular theme of a more general phenom-
enon: grouping and meter that are out of phase (see section 2.3). The
bracketing procedure outlined so far applies only to in-phase passages.

The solution for out-of-phase passages lies in the strong intuitive no-
tions of u«pbeat and afterbeat. As discussed in section 2.3, a weak beat is
heard as an afterbeat to the immediately preceding strong beat unless a
grouping boundary intervenes between the two. If a grouping boundary
intervenes, the weak beat is associated as an upbeat with the immediately
following strong beat. If we compare all the fourth beats in 6.3, we
indeed find that those of measures 11, 13, and 14 are heard as afterbeats,
but that this hearing is not possible for the fourth beat of measure 12
because of the grouping articulation immediately to its left. Instead, the
primary sense of the Ff on the fourth beat of measure 12 is that it belongs
as an anacrusis to the succeeding phrase.

The revised subgroup bracketing in 6.4 reflects these intuitions.

Measures unaffected by out-of-phase conditions, such as 11 and 14,
receive subgroup bracketings as above. Any such bracketing we call a
regular time-span. But in the out-of-phase region, the grouping structure
