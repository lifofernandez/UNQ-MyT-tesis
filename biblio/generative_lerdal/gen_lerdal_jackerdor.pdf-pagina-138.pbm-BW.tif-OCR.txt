Our first task is to see how the b and c dominate all other events in a
phrase. There is no problem with the b: it results naturally from the
reductional process; it is whatever emerges as the most stable event be-
fore the cadence in a phrase. Often the b is the first event in a phrase, as in
the Mozart K. 331 phrase (see example 5.12) or the first phrase of the
Bach chorale; often it is the second or third event, as in the second phrase
of the chorale (as suggested in example 6.12). More rarely it occurs in the
middle of a phrase. The germane point is that a b is always heard as
associated with a corresponding c; if a time-span lacks a c, then it lacks a
b. A phrase can be characterized roughly as the smallest level of grouping
in which there is a b andac.

The treatment of cadences is more complicated, for two reasons. First,
the half cadence or the deceptive cadence might not emerge simply on
grounds of pitch stability as structurally important at the phrase level.
Second, the full cadence and the deceptive cadence possess two members,
joined together as a unit; in both, neither member would have remotely
the same meaning if the other did not function with it. This suggests that
in certain respects the two-membered cadence should be counted as one
event.

The Mozart K. 331 theme illustrates both points. One hears the first
phrase as progressing from I to a half-cadential V and the second phrase
as progressing from I to a V—I full cadence (6.14a). The tree should
express this hearing. But unless the cadences are treated specially, the Lin
measure 4 dominates the half cadence because its pitch structure is more
“stable” (as discussed in section $.4); and the V in the full cadence
already disappears at a local level because it has not been joined to the
final I. The absurd result is sketched in the incomplete reduction in 6.14b.

To avoid results such as 6.14b, we must regard cadences as signs, or
conventional formulas, that mark and articulate the ends of groups from
phrase levels to the most global levels of musical structure. In any well-
established style, the repertory of cadences is very limited—for classical
tonal music, only V—I, V, and V-vi, with occasional variants. (Because
the plagal cadence is always an elaboration of the l in the full cadence, it
need not be specified.) The theory can therefore “find” these signs when
they occur at the ends of groups, and label them as functioning caden-
tially for all the levels of grouping that terminate with them. The labeling
retains cadences regardless of other reductional criteria, and unifies both
elements of two-membered cadences.

The need for such labeling of cadences can be approached in another
way. If they were not labeled, global levels of reduction would simply
calculate the duration of harmonic areas in a piece; that is, each large-
level group would be reduced to just the tonic or local tonic. For exam-
ple, the minuet and trio of Beethoven's Sonata op. 10, no. 3, would
