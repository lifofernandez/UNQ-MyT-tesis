formulaic extension of the tonic in measures 1—4 (measures 1 and 4 are
in a sense equal). This, however, produces an idiosyncratically out-of-
phase pattern with the grouping structure, which is clearly four bars long
at the beginning; MPR 1 militates against this solution. We prefer to
locate the change at measure 8, in conjunction with a combined grouping
overlap and metrical deletion. Measures 5-6 and 7-8 form parallel
groups, as do measures 8-11 and 16-19; thus, by GPR 6, measure 8
functions in both directions. Also, since there is no essential harmonic
motion from measure 8 to measure 9, it is plausible to think of measure
8 as an unequivocal suspension, hence in a strong metrical position
(MPR 8). The result is shown in 10,10.

The larger grouping levels are difficult to determine. For example,
should measures 5-11 belong to measures 1-4, or to measures 12-19,
within the larger group of measures 1-19? Should measures 20—23 be-
long to measures 1-—19 or to measures 20—35? In both cases, the issue has
been decided by the resultant time-span and prolongational reductions
(GPR 7). This is a good illustration of how interactive the individual
components are—in short, how holistic musical perception is, hence how
difficult it is to develop an algorithm for the derivation of structural
descriptions.

A few remarks are needed about the time-span reduction in 10.10.
First, the arpeggiations have already been fused (time-span reduction
well-formedness rule 3b) at the measure level. Second, we have interpo-
lated a missing chord function (a 1i$) (TSRWEFR 3c) berween measures 21
and 22, since the suspended E in measure 21 does not resolve to a D until
measure 23, by which time the chord has changed. In our analysis, this
underlying ii$ stands behind the entire subdominant passage (measures
20—23). Third, we have taken the liberty in level b of the secondary
notation of raising the structural V (measure 24) an octave, to bring it
into the “obligatory register” of the piece as a whole. This operation
would not be meaningful at smaller levels because of the descent to the
lower octave in measures 6—19; the events at the lower octave must be
eliminated first. Strictly, this operation is not part of the grammar. We
have included it here, however, to show how octave transfers might
eventually be incorporated into the theory not just in a general way but at
specific reductional levels.

The locus of analytic interest in the Bach C Major Prelude lies in its
prolongational reduction (10.11). Beneath its multifarious branchings
(which derive by a straightforward application of PRPRs 1 and 3), there is
an underlying regularity: doubly or triply embedded left-branching pro-
gressions contained within a (strong or weak) prolongation. As the
brackets below the music in 10.11 show, every event except the opening
tonic is implicated in or subsumed under such a structure, The beautiful
coherence of the piece resides to a great extent in this abstract prolonga-
tional feature.
