These subtle variations in articulation are typical of the strategies used
by performers to influence perceived grouping. However, it is important
to emphasize that the performer's conscious awareness of these strategies
often does not go beyond “phrasing it this way rather than that way”;
thatis, in large part these strategies are learned and used unconsciously.
In making explicit the effect of such strategies on musical cognition, we
have suggested how our theory potentially addresses issues relevant to
performance problems.

In support of the claim that the rules of grouping are not style-specific, we
analyze the grouping structure of the opening of Stravinsky's Three
Pieces for Clarinet Solo (example 3.34) in terms of the rules developed
here. As in the Mozart G Minor Symphony fragment, each note is num-
bered for convenience in discussion, and applications of GPRs 2 and3 are
marked at appropriate transitions. We assume that the breath mark is in
effect an indication to the performer to produce a grouping boundary by
means of one or both of the strategies just discussed: shortening the
preceding note and leaving a space (which provides evidence for the
slur/rest rule, GPR 2a), and perhaps lengthening the time berween attack
points (which provides evidence for the attack-point rule, GPR 2b). In
addition to rule applications, the example shows the smallest levels of
grouping predicted by the rules.

The dashed slurs in 3.34 require some explanation. Consider first tran-
sition 2-3. Although there is weak evidence for a grouping boundary at
this point due to the change in note values, one tends to hear events 1-4
grouped together and to suppress the smaller groups. In section 3.3 we
suggested an alternative version of GPR 1: “Avoid analyses with very
small groups—the smaller, the less preferable.” This version of the rule
would say that the weak evidence at transition 2-3 is insufficient to
establish a group boundary there, because of the shortness of the result-
ing groups.

At transition 9-10 there is no local evidence to support a group bound-
ary, but parallelism with transition 2-3 andits context would argue for a
