Again, the longer of two alternating patterns of articulation attracts the
stronger beat. In 4.30 the beginning of the triplet pattern is somewhat
more likely to be heard as the strong beat at the dotted-half level than the
beginning of the sixteenths. In other words, from the point of view of
MPR $, example 4.30 behaves like the rhythmic pattern shown below

 

So far pitch has not been implicated in the metrical preference rules.
But the repetition of a pitch also counts as a kind of length, as shown by
the preference for 4.31 to be heard with the first C on a strong beat of the
quarter-note level and (less decisively) the half-note level.

The rule of length applies to repeated pitches not only at the surface,
but also at relevant levels of the time-span reduction.* Consider the upper
line in 4.32, which has the preferred metrical structure shown.

The slurring establishes the preferred placement of beats at the quarter-
note level, but beyond that there is nothing in the musical surface to
account for larger metrical levels. On the other hand, as will emerge in
