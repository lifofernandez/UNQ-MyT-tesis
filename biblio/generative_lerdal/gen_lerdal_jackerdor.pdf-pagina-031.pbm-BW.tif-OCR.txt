not that a given group is stronger or weaker than another group, but
rather that the strongest beat in a given group is stronger or weaker than
the strongest beat in another group. These relationships are represented
accurately in 2.12.

If level 2 in 2.13 was problematic, level 3 is doubly so. Here the
“accent” covers measures 5—8, presumably because of the “cadential
weight” at measure 8. Thus the sign “—”, which at level 1 stood for
metrical accent, now signifies structural accent. Whether or not this
structural accent should coincide with a large-scale metrical accent (we
think not, for reasons discussed in the next section), it clearly does not
spread over the 4-bar group.

These (and other) difficulties in 2.13 derive from a common source.
The methodology of Cooper and Meyer—an adaptation from traditional
prosody —requires that any group contain exactly one strong accent and
one or two weak accents, and any larger-level group must fill its accen-
tual pattern by means of accents standing for exactly two or three
smaller-level groups. Thus only two levels of metrical structure (“—” and
“—”) can be represented within any group, regardless of the real metrical
situation. Far more serious, however, is that this procedure thoroughly
interweaves the properties of, and the analysis of, grouping and meter.
Once these components are disentangled and analyzed separately, as in
2.12, all these difficulties disappear.*

To illustrate briefly the kind of analytic insight that can emerge from
our proposed notation for grouping and meter, let us look again at the
opening of Mozart's G Minor Symphony (2.14a), this time with both
structures indicated. Examples 2.14b and 2.14c isolate fragments of the
analysis for comparison. lt is significant that the metrical structure of the
first wo-measure group (2.14c) is identical with that of the initial motive
(2.14b), but at larger metrical levels. No doubt the theme as a whole
sounds richer, more “logical,” because of this rhythmic relationship.
