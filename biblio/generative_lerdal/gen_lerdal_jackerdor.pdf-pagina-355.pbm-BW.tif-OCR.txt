Prolongational
Reduction

351

PRWER 1 (p. 214)
There is a single event in the underlying grouping structure of every piece
that functions as prolongational head.

PRWER 2 (p. 214)

An event e; can be a direct elaboration of another event e; in any of the

following ways:

a. e, is a strong prolongation of e; if the roots, bass notes, and melodic
notes of the two events are identical.*

b. e; is a weak prolongation of e; if the roots of the two events are
identical but the bass and/or melodic notes differ.*

c. e, is a progression to or from e; if the harmonic roots of the two events
are different.*

PRWER 3 (p. 214)
Every event in the underlying grouping structure is either the prolonga-
tional head or a recursive elaboration of the prolongational head.

PRWER 4 (No Crossing Branches) (p. 215)

If an event e;is a direct elaboration of an event e;, every event between e;
and e; must be a direct elaboration of either e;, e;, or some event berween
them.

PRER 1 (Time-Span Importance) (p. 220)

In choosing the prolongationally most important event ey of a prolonga-
tional region (e;—e;), strongly prefer a choice in which e, is relatively
time-span-important.

PRER 2 (Time-Span Segmentation) (p. 221)

Let ex be the prolongationally most important event in a prolongational
region (e;—e). If there is a time-span that contains e; and e but not e;,
prefer a prolongational reduction in which ey is an elaboration of e;;
similarly with the roles of e; and e; reversed.

PRPR 3 (Prolongational Connection) (p. 224)

In choosing the prolongationally most important event e; in a prolonga-
tional region (e;—e;), prefer an ex that attaches so as to form a maximally
stable prolongational connection with one of the endpoints of the region.

Stability Conditions for Prolongational Connection (p. 224)
1. (Branching condition)
a. Right strong prolongations are more stable than right weak prolon-
gations, which in turn are more stable than right progressions.
b. Left progressions are more stable than left weak prolongations,
which in turn are more stable than left strong prolongations.
