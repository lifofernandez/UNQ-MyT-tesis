Metrical Preference
Rules

Finally, the choice of tactus is related to harmonic rhythm. A piece with
frequent functional harmonic change is heard with a faster tactus than a
piece with equal note values but less frequent harmonic change. Roughly,
each beat of the tactus must have only a single functional harmony. This
last intuition involves the rules of time-span and prolongational reduc-
tion in a way not completely clear to us. We leave a formalization of the
preference rules determining the tactus for future research.

The revisions proposed in this section create a stratified rather than a
uniform metrical structure. The tactus is the central and most prominent
of the metrical levels, and is regular throughout. The levels immediately
smaller and immediately larger than the tactus likewise tend to be regular
and aurally prominent. As the structure extends to extremely small and
large levels, metrical intuition tends to fade out. Irregularity and extra-
metricality are tolerated at small levels; levels larger than one or two
measures are often somewhat irregular, Â¡f present at all,

Having defined the possible metrical structures for tonal music, we turn
to the problem of relating these structures to a presented musical surface.
To make the problem clear, note that all three metrical structures as-
signed to the beginning of the Mozart G Minor Symphony in example 4.9
conform to the metrical well-formedness rules, but only the first describes
real musical intuition. It is the task of the preference rules to select, out of
the possible metrical structures, just those that the listener hears.

This example, like succeeding ones in this chapter, is presented without
bars and beams so as not to prejudice the preferred reading. Bars and
beams are notational devices that convey preferred metrical structure to
the performer, but they are not present in the musical surface (the se-
quence of pitches and durations).

Parallelism and Connection with Grouping

As we develop the metrical preference rules, it will be useful to investigate
patterns that are to be repeated an indefinite number of times. The length
of the pattern, three or four eighth notes, determines whether the metrical
