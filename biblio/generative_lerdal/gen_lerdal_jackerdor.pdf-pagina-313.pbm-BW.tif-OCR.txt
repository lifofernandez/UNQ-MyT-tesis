The rules relating syntactic quantifier position and relative embedding
of quantifiers in logical form have been discussed at great length in both
the philosophical and linguistic literature. But among the difficulties in
most accounts (including Jackendoff 1972) has been the assumprtion that
these rules are well-formedness rules— thatis, that there are principles of
the usual grammatical sort that clearly determine the relationship. Ioup
1975 shows that this assumption is false, and that the relationship is in
part mediated by what in the present context appear to be preference
rules.

Ioup takes seriously the observation, made occasionally in the litera-
ture, that ambiguous sentences containing two quantifiers often have a
preferred reading.? Her preference rules can be stated as follows:

Preference Rule 1 Given two quantifiers in the same surface clause, pref-
erably assign larger scope to the quantifier that is higher on the follow-
ing scale, or hierarchy: each>every >all>most>many>several>some>
a few.

Preference Rule 2 Given two quantifiers in the same surface clause, pref-
erably assign larger scope to the one in more salient surface position,
defined as the hierarchy topic>deep and surface subject>deep or surface
subject but not both>indirect object>preposition object>direct object.

Ioup shows these preferences to hold over a wide range of languages
(where the hierarchy in rule 1 is defined over the closest translations of
the quantifiers), and claims that they are universal. Furthermore, the
hierarchy of syntactic positions is almost the same as one independently
motivated for other purposes, so it is not totally ad hoc in this rule.
Though Ioup does not work out very fully the interaction of the two
rules, the overall pattern looks very much like what we expect from
preference rules: variable strength application, which yields strongly pre-
ferred interpretations when rule applications reinforce, ambiguity when
rule applications of commensurate strength conflict, and exceptions to a
rule when its weak application is overridden by strong application of
another rule.

The preference rules for quantifier scope are a relatively small sub-
system embedded in a large system of well-formedness rules. The next
examples are more extensive, though they have the disadvantage of not
having been given as satisfactory a formal treatment.

Pragmatics

Under normal circumstances we use sentences to mean what they mean
literally. But a substantial body of literature under the rubric “prag-
matics” has discussed utterances in which the speaker does not literally
mean what he says. Among the best-known examples are the uses of the
sentences in 12.3, which are literally requests for an answer of yes or ro,
as requests for the salt.
