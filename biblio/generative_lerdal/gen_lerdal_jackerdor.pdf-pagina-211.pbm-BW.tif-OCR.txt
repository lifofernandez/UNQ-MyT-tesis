prolongs the V in measure 11. Third, the codetta is represented by the
tonic prolongational repetition from measure 23 to measure 29. Be-
neath the secondary notation in 8.35a is shown the (rounded binary)
A+B+A'+codetta form of the piece; note how noncongruent it is with
the prolongational groupings. From level f in 8.33, 8.35b adds the re-
maining structural accents, the V in measure 5 and the I in measure 6.
Also included are the cadential preparations in measures 4 and 9, corre-
sponding to the ii5 in measure 22.

The portion of the tree within the dashed area a, signifying the
antecedent-consequent period of measures 1-10, repeats the global tree
1n 8.34c; this is a good example of self-embedding. Areas b and c draw
attention to the fact that the I prolongation in measures 23—-29 balances
the V prolongation in measures 11—18. The coherence of the piece hangs
in part on these prolongational relationships.

As all the phrases are now framed by their most important events, we
can turn next to their internal structures one by one.

The major point of prolongational interest in the antecedent phrase in
measures 1—5 concerns the pivotal role of the vi chord in measure 3.
Should it be a right or a left branch? Rhythmic and motivic consider-
ations direct it as a tensing motion off the previous V in measure 3, but
harmonically it is already part of the cadential nucleus. The analysis in
8.36c suggests both possibilities with dashed branches. Also worth point-
ng out in 8.36c is the slight tensing-relaxing motion at the cadence,
enclosed within the larger relaxation of the ii*—V progression. Finally,
observe that the neighboring IV chord in measure 2 attaches as a right,
not a left, branch; this is due to the influence of the time-span segmenta-
tion, a prolongational principle to be discussed in section 9.4. The conse-
quent phrase in measures 6-10 requires no additional comment.
