First consider some left-branching possibilities. In 8.15a the half-
cadential V attaches to the final V, producing a prolongational antici-
pation. However, as argued above, this makes no sense over such an
interval of time: How could the first V relax rhythmically into the sec-
ond? More plausible would be to make the half-cadential V the most
important V in the passage, with the final V as a prolongational repeti-
tion (8.15b). But this alternative is dubious because the final V no longer
cadences the entire passage (recall the discussion in section 6.5 about the
location of the structural dominant).

Perhaps most significantly, 8.15a and 8.15b both fail on the grounds
that the opening I of the consequent cannot then connect as a right
branch with the initial I, because that would result in crossing branches
with the half-cadential V. The attachment of the two Is beginning the two
phrases seems particularly essential when, as 1s usually the case, thematic
para!lelism reinforces the harmonic return of the I; one hears the second I
as a repetition—a starting over—of the first 1. In prolongational branch-
ing this relationship is expressed by a strong prolongational repetition, in
which case the half-cadential V must itself be enclosed within a tonic
prolongation as in 8.16.

This leaves two possibilities for attachment of the half-cadential V: as a
left-branching progression to the opening I of the consequent (8.17a) or
as a right-branching departure from the initial tonic (8.17b).
