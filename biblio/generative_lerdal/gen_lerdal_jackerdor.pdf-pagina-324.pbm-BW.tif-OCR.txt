For our present comparison, an interesting aspect of English foot for-
mation 1s the behavior of unstressed syllables at the beginning of a word.
In one proposed treatment of them, the structure of words like attire,
vanilla, and America is as in 12.14 (though the mechanism for deriving
this structure has been open to dispute—see Selkirk 1980).

12.14

attire vanilla America

sy//ab!e level u i e
foot level — — [
_

word level N —1 — 1_ —

In 12.14 we find an unstressed initial syllable preceding a monosyllabic, a
bisyllabic, and a trisyllabic foot. The initial syllable is not simply an odd
syllable added at the beginning of the word, but is adjoined to the rest as
the beginning of an extra foot level. For us this solution is particularly
significant because of its parallel with the treatment of upbeats in time-
span segmentation (see examples 6.4 and 6.5 and section 7.1). In each
case a weak segment separated by a major boundary (a group boundary
in music, a word boundary in language) from the preceding strong seg-
ment is instead adjoined to the following segment. Hence, beyond the
formal parallel of a layered hierarchy in both grammars, the segmenta-
tion rules display an interesting substantive parallel.?

At the next layer of the hierarchy the segmentation into words is
obvious. We only have to note that compounds such as blackboard and
labor union have two word levels, as shown in 12.15.

word level L — — aa

However, it remains to be shown how the feet of a multifoot word are
structured. Selkirk, following Liberman and Prince, gathers the two
rightmost feet into a segment, then gathers that with the next to the left,
and so on until the left-hand boundary of the word is reached. For
example, reconciliation, with three feet, receives the structure shown in
12.16. (Selkirk”s notation does not accord the segment -ciliation the label
“foot,” but there appears to be no harm in it.)
