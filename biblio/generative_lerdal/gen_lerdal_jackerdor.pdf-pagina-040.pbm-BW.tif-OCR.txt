Grouping Structure

Chapter 2 presented the analytic system for two aspects of musical
structure: grouping and meter. This chapter and the next address the
formalization of these two components of the analytic system, showing
how the structures used in analysis are rigorously characterized and how
they are related to actual pieces of music in a rule-governed way.

In presenting our hypotheses about the grammar of tonal music we will
attempt to motivate as fully as possible each rule, so that the reader can
follow each step in building up what turns out to be a rather intricate
system. Ideally we would explore a number of alternative formulations
and defend our choice against them, but limitations of space and patience
preclude doing so to any great extent. The reader should nevertheless
be aware that alternative formulations are possible, and that defects in
one aspect of the theory often can be remedied by relatively minor
modifications.

This chapter is devoted to the organization of the musical surface into
groups. From a psychological point of view, grouping of a musical sur-
face is an auditory analog of the partitioning of the visual field into
objects, parts of objects, and parts of parts of objects. More than any
other component of the musical grammar, the grouping component ap-
pears to be of obvious psychological interest, in that the grammar that
describes grouping structure seems to consist largely of general condi-
tions for auditory pattern perception that have far broader application
than for music alone. Moreover, the rules for grouping seem to be
idiom-independentâ€”ethat is, a listener needs to know relatively little
about a musical idiom in order to assign grouping structure to pieces in
that idiom.

Like the other components of the musical grammar, the grouping
component consists of two sets of rules. Grouping well-formedness rules
(GWEFRs) establish the formal structure of grouping patterns and their
relationship to the string of pitch-events that form a piece; these rules are
