To accommodate this analysis, MWERs 1 and 2 must be slightly modified
as follows:

MWER 1 (revised) Every attack point must be associated with a beat at
the smallest metrical level present at that point in the piece.

MWER 2 (revised) Every beat at a given level must also be a beat at all
smaller levels present at that point in the piece.

This modification is still not quite enough to deal with the Brahms
example (4.5), since the quarter-note tactus cannot be subdivided in a
uniform way throughout the passage, as required by MWER 4. The intu-
ition behind the tactus, however, is that its subdivision can be relatively
free, whereas the alternation between strong and weak beats of the tactus
is relatively fixed. This suggests that MWEFR 4 be weakened for subtactus
levels. The revised version of MWER 4 is the point in the well-formedness
rules where the tactus is explicitly mentioned:

MWER 4 (revised) The tactus and immediately larger metrical levels
must consist of beats equally spaced throughout the piece. At subtactus
metrical levels, weak beats must be equally spaced between the sur-
rounding strong beats.

This revision makes the tactus the minimal metrical level that is required
to be continuous (though there is nothing prohibiting smaller levels from
being continuous too). It also permits the tactus to be subdivided into
threes at one point and twos at another, as long as particular beats of the
tactus are evenly subdivided.

The quintuplet in example 4.5 still poses a problem, since MWER 3
does not allow subdivisions into five, and since there is no possible inter-
mediate metrical level with evenly spaced beats, as required by MWER 4.
The correct solution here does not appear to be to allow subdivision into
fives, since quintuplets are so rare in the metrical idiom we are consider-
ing. Rather, there is a class of musical devices that do not receive metrical
structure: grace notes, trills, turns, and the like. These extrametrical
events normally are fast relative to the tactus. Intuition suggests they are
exempt from the MWERs. The quintuplet in 4.5 appears to belong to this
category, as do the lengthy ornamental flourishes of Chopin. A refine-
ment to include extrametrical events is possible, but we will not pursue it
here.

It should be noted that the revised MWER 4, though it allows incom-
mensurate subdivisions of the tactus level, prohibits them at immediately
