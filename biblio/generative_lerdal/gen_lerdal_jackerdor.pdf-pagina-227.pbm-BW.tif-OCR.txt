discussed in section 8.3. As pointed out there, one of the characteristics of
the more sophisticated listener is his ability to overcome this pressure for
a “bottom-up” analysis and to hear larger-scale patterns of tension and
relaxation that cut across phrase boundaries. We now turn to the evi-
dence such a listener uses for these patterns: the harmonic and melodic
connections among events.

Stability of Prolongational Connection
We can state the preference rule for stability of connection in preliminary
form as follows:

PRPR 3 (Stability of Connection, preliminary form) Let e; be the pro-
longationally most important event in a prolongational region (e;—e;).
Prefer a prolongational reduction in which e; is an elaboration of that
endpoint with which it forms the more stable prolongational connection.

PRPR 3 conflicts with PRPR 2 if e; and ey fall in a group together but e;
and e; form a more stable connection across a group boundary. Before
exploring such conflicts we must refine this preliminary rule in two ways.
First, the notion of stable prolongational connection must be clarified (We
return to this in a moment). Second, the rule as stated addresses only the
case in Which the most important event e, in a region has already been
chosen; but numerous cases arise in which e; cannot be chosen on
grounds of time-span importance alone (by PRPR 1). Consider 9.8, a
typical antecedent-consequent pattern.

The prolongational tree for the beginning and the final cadence is the
“basic form” discussed in section 8.3. The next most time-span impor-
tant events are the end of the antecedent and the beginning of the con-
sequent. Because these two events are of equal time-span importance,
PRPR 1 cannot choose which of them is e, for the region from the I to the
V of the full cadence. Hence PRPR 3 as stated above cannot apply to
establish any attachment.

The solution to this difficulty is to restate PRPR 3 so it can affect the
choice of e, as well as its attachment:
