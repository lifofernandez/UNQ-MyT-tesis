The branching for measures 11—14, the first half of the contrasting
section, proceeds without complication (8.36b). Note that since the en-
tire passage is under a V prolongation, the I in measure 14 must be
subordinate to the V in measure 11. The “answer” in measures 15—18,
on the other hand, is difficult to analyze, because melodic and harmonic
factors conflict and because of the ambiguous function of the 4 chord in
measure 16. The analysis in 8.36b emphasizes melodic factors; it says
that the Eb in measure 15 is heard as a neighbor note under the prolonga-
tion of D from measure 14 to measure 16. Emphasis on harmonic factors
leads to the branching in 8.36c, in which the subdominant motion
toward the cadential V in measure 18 begins already at measure 15.

The reprise in measure 19-23 needs no comment. The codetta in
measures 23—29 produces two sequences of left-branching resolutions—
echoes, as it were, of the real resolution at measure 23—within a num-
ber of prolongational repetitions (8.36d).

The overall prolongational reduction of the Chorale St. Antoni ap-
pears in 8.37. As a visual aid, we have divided the secondary notation
into two levels, marked a and ». The dashed line slicing across the tree
reflects this division in that all the branching connections made above the
line belong to level a and all those below the line belong to level b (the
events in level a correspond to 8.35b). It should be apparent from our
presentation of the branchings for each phrase that competing “pre-
ferred” analyses for local levels are possible, and that our discussion of
various prolongational details has not been exhaustive.5
