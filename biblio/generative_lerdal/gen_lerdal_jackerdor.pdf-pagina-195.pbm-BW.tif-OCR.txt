8.17

 

Though 8.17a is plausible when the V leads texturally into the I, much
more common is the sense of a syntactic break berween the half-cadential
V and the opening I of the consequent. As a result, the V is felt primarily
as a departure from the initial I. Thus the usual prolongational transla-
tion of the time-span tree in 8.14a is the tree in 8.17b. This tree says that,
within the basic form as described above, the initial I prolongs into its
repetition at the opening of the consequent; and, within this prolonga-
tion, the half-cadential V primarily tenses in relation to the initial 1.

Cadential Preparation

Now we will consider the single complete phrase as our analytic world.
First we will discuss the events leading up to the cadence (“cadential
preparation”), and then we will turn to the events in the phrase between
the opening tonic and the cadential preparation.

Before directly addressing cadential preparations, we need to interpo-
late a few remarks about circle-of-fifths progressions. Generally, one
wants to say that V is to l asii is to V and vi is to ii, and so on; each event
in the sequence relates similarly to its adjacent events. Because V is less
consonant than I (and 1i less consonant than V, and so on), a I-V pro-
gression receives a right branch and a V-—I progression a left branch.
Since these relationships apply sequentially, an ascending circle of fifths
tends to result in a successively embedded right-branching structure
(8.18a) and a descending circle of fifths in a successively embedded left-
branching structure (8.18b).
