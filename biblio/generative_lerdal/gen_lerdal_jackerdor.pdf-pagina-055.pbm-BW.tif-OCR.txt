GPR 6 (Parallelism) Where two or more segments of the music can be
construed as parallel, they preferably form parallel parts of groups.

The application of GPR 6 to 3.22 is obvious: the maximal parallelism is
achieved if the “motive” is three notes long in 3.22a and four notes long
in 3.22b.

However, consider what happens if a contrary articulation is applied
to 3.22a, as in 3.23.

3.23

 

One's intuition is that a grouping into threes is now relatively unnatural.
The theory accounts for this as follows: the slur/rest rule places rather
strong potential group boundaries in 3.23 after every fourth note, where
the slurs are broken; thus each of the three-note segments so obvious in
3.22a comes to have an internal group boundary in a different place.
Since motivic parallelism requires (among other things) parallel internal
grouping, 3.23 cannot be segmented into three-note parallel groups
nearly as easily as 3.22a can. Thus GPR 6 either is overridden by the
slur/rest rule or actually fails to apply.

GPR 6 says specifically that parallel passages should be analyzed as
forming parallel parts of groups rather than entire groups. Itis stated this
way in order to deal with the common situation in which groups begin
in parallel fashion and diverge somewhere in the middle, often in order
for the second group to make a cadential formula. (More rarely, paral-
lelism occurs at ends of groups.) A clear example is 3.24, the opening of
Beethoven's Quartet op. 18, no. 1.

 

GPR 6, reinforced by the slur/rest rule, analyzes the first four measures as
two two-measure groups. The fifth measure resembles the first and third,
but at that point the similarity ends. If GPR 6 demanded total parallelism
it could not make use of the similarity of measures 1, 3, and 5. But as we
have chosen to state the rule above, it can use this parallelism to help
establish grouping.

In the Mozart example (3.19), GPR 6 has two effects. First, it reinforces
the intensification and symmetry rules in assigning the major grouping
division at the middle of the passage. Second, recall that GPR 2a, the
slur/rest rule, marks a possible group boundary at transitions 8-9 and
