The appropriate events can be identified as the endpoints of the largest
prolongational region entirely contained within a cadenced group. Let us
call these events the prolongational beginning and prolongational ending
of the group. They will usually, but not always, coincide with the struc-
tural beginning and ending defined by the time-span reduction.

It remains to specify the nature of normative structure. Observe that
the double left branching in 9.19 is due to the fact that full cadences
already have two events in them, one connected as a left branch to the
other. Instead of literally specifying double left embedding, it is advan-
tageous to require simply a cadential preparation, that 1s, one significant
left branch attached to the designated cadence. This formulation general-
izes to half cadences, where the normative prolongational ending is a V
chord prepared by one previous significant event as its highest elabora-
tion. This was the structure at the half cadence in measure 4 in K. 331 1n
the previous section, for instance. Such a description of normative form
also generalizes to phrases with deceptive cadences, in which the prolon-
gational ending is the V rather than the vi. Here again, one significant left
branch is the norm. In nearly all cases, the desired left branch is “sub-
dominant” in function.

Section 8.3 pointed out that for music of the Classical period, but not
the Baroque, normative structure also includes a prolongation of the
prolongational beginning, standing often for the beginning of a conse-
quent or a reprise. In stating the rule for normative structure, we include
this variant in parentheses. We now have the elements necessary for a
statement of the rule.

PRPR 6 (Normative Prolongational Structure) A cadenced group prefer-

ably contains four (five) elements in its prolongational structure:

a. a prolongational beginning,

b. a prolongational ending consisting of one element of the cadence,

(c. a right-branching prolongation as the most important direct elabora-
tion of the prolongational beginning,)

d. a right-branching progression as the (next) most important direct elab-
oration of the prolongational beginning,

e. a left-branching “subdominant” progression as the most important

elaboration of the first element of the cadence.

PRPR 6 is involved in the derivation of the “basic form” described in
section 8.3. Consider a piece whose largest levels of time-span reduction
are as in 9.20.
