convenient to view all cs, regardless of type, as undifferentiated entities;
the details of cadential reduction are reserved for the next section.

Imagine a piece in four phrases, grouped together as in 6.15a. As an
aid, we place a number, signifying the number of measures spanned,
within each grouping slur. We find the bs and cs and supply each with
one or more subscripts corresponding to the groups that it begins or
cadences, Suppose (not implausibly) that each b is about as stable, purely
by pitch criteria, as each c. In short, disregard all factors except the bs,
the cs, and the regions over which they operate.

Example 6.15b connects the b and c of each phrase as in 6.13b.c.
Whether the b or the c is structurally most important in a particular
phrase is determined by the role each plays in the larger grouping struc-
ture; that is, by whether it functions as a b or c for a larger group. Thus,
as indicated by the subscripts, the c of the first phrase is a c only for that
phrase, butits b is also a b at the next larger grouping level; hence the b is
