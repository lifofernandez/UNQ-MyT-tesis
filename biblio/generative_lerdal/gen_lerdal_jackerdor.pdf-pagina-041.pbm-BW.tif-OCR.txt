presented in section 3.1. Grouping preference rules (GPRs) establish
which of the formally possible structures that can be assigned to a piece
correspond to the listener's actual intuitions; these are developed in sec-
tions 3.2 and 3.3. Section 3.4 deals with grouping overlap. Section 3.5
briefly addresses some questions of musical performance. Section 3.6
presents two additional analyses.

Before beginning to discuss the grammar of grouping structure, we
must enter an important caveat. At the present stage of development of
the theory, we are treating all music as essentially homophonic; that is,
we assume that a single grouping analysis suffices for all voices of a piece.
For the more contrapuntal varieties of tonal music, where this condition
does not obtain, our theory is inadequate. We consider an extension of
the theory to account for polyphonic music to be of great importance.
However, we will not attempt to treat such music here except by
approximation.

This section defines the formal notion group by stating the conditions
that all possible grouping structures must satisfy. In effect these condi-
tions define a strict, nonoverlapping, recursive hierarchy in the sense
discussed in section 2.1. As a sample of the notation, 3.1 repeats the
grouping for the first few bars of melody in the Mozart G Minor Sym-
phony, K. 550.1

The first rule defines the basic notion of a group.

GWER 1 Any contiguous seguence of pitch-events, drum beats, or the
like can constitute a group, and only contiguous sequences can constitute
a group.

GWER 1 permits all groups of the sort designated in 3.1, and prevents
certain configurations from being designated as groups. For example, it
prevents all the eighth notes in 3.1 from being designated together as a
group, or the first six occurrences of the pitch D. (The contiguity condi-
tion is what makes the slur notation a viable representation of grouping
intuitions; if there could be discontinuous groups some other notation
would have to be devised.)

The second rule expresses the intuition that a piece is heard as a whole
rather than merely as a sequence of events.
