square is moved still farther to the left, as in 3.12c, the principle of
proximity exerts an even stronger effect and succeeds in overriding the
principle of similarity; intuition now clearly groups it with the left group,
though some conflict may still be sensed. Parallel musical examples ap-

Thus three important properties of the principles of grouping have
emerged. First, intuitions about grouping are of variable strength, de-
pending on the degree to which individual grouping principles apply.
Second, different grouping principles can either reinforce each other (re-
sulting in stronger judgments) or conflict (resulting in weak or ambiguous
judgments). Third, one principle may override another when the intu-
itions they would individually produce are in conflict. The formal system
of preference rules for musical perception developed in this study pos-
sesses these same properties. The term preference rule is chosen because
the rules establish not inflexible decisions about structure, but relative
preferences among a number of logically possible analyses; our hypothe-
sis is that one hears a musical surface in terms of that analysis (or those
analyses) that represent the highest degree of overall preference when all
preference rules are taken into account. We will call such an analysis the
“most highly preferred” or “most stable.”?

We have illustrated the intuitions behind preference rules with ele-
mentary visual examples as well as musical ones in order to show that the
preference-rule formalism is not an arbitrary device invented solely to
make musical analyses work out properly. Rather it is an empirical hy-
pothesis about the nature of human perception. Cognitive systems that
behave according to the characteristics of preference rules appear to be
widespread in psychological theories. But the identification of preference
rules as a distinctive and general form of mental representation seems to

have gone unnoticed since the time of Wertheimer (whose work lacked
the notion of a generative rule system). The introduction of preference
