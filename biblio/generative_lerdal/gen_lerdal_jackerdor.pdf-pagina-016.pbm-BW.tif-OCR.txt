Introduction to Rhythmic Structure

This chapter introduces those aspects of rhythmic structure inferred by
the listener that do not directly involve pitch. A guiding principle
throughout will be that rhythmic intuition must not be oversimplified. In
our view, an adequate account of rhythm first of all requires the accurate
identification of individual rhythmic dimensions. The richness of rhythm
can then be seen as the product of their interaction.

The first rhythmic distinction that must be made is between grouping
and meter, When hearing a piece, the listener naturally organizes the
sound signals into units such as motives, themes, phrases, periods,
theme-groups, sections, and the piece itself. Performers try to breathe (or
phrase) berween rather than within units. Our generic term for these
units is group. At the same time, the listener instinctively infers a regular
pattern of strong and weak beats to which he relates the actual musical
sounds. The conductor waves his baton and the listener taps his foot at a
particular level of beats. Generalizing conventional usage, our term for
these patterns of beats is meter.

Sections 2.1 and 2.2 present grouping structure and metrical structure
as independent components of rhythmic organization and develop their
analytic notations. Section 2.3 sketches how these two components inter-
relate. Section 2.4 discusses the notion of “structural accent” and shows
how it interacts with grouping and meter. Aspects of rhythm directly
involving pitch structure will be dealt with in the chapters on time-span
and prolongational reduction.

Whatever intrinsic interest our formulations of grouping and meter
may have, they are not merely ends in themselves. We originally devel-
oped these formulations because no principled account of pitch reduction
was possible without them. In this sense the purely rhythmic part of this
book (chapters 2-4) is an extended preliminary to the reductional part
(chapters 5-9).
