on the third beat; the appoggiatura covering the first and second beats is
eliminated. However, in measure $ there is a conflict. The B minor chord
in the first half, originating as an anacrusis in the surface, is the structural
beginning for the phrase, but the chord in the second half of the measure
is the dominant (vii6) of the cadence. Neither can be eliminated at the
whole-note level without losing the musical sense. In order to resolve this
conflict, we permit the B minor chord to be the head of measure 5, but let
measure 6 “borrow” the head of the second half of measure 5 for the
sake of retaining the cadence. In this way, both halves of measure 5 are
retained at the whole-note level.

The general solution to the reduction of cadences, therefore, is to
permit the retention of a dominant penult just in case it is the head of a
time-span immediately preceding the time-span headed by the final. In a
feminine cadence the penult will fall in a larger time-span with the final,
but in a masculine cadence the penult will be “borrowed” from a preced-
ing time-span.

Example 7.15 also shows how a cadence is reduced out when it is
directly subordinate to another event. The essential intuition is that the
penult is heard most saliently in relation to its final. Thus when the
cadence is about to be eliminated there is a preliminary step in which the
penult is reduced out in favor of the final, followed by the ordinary
reduction of the final itself. This special case of reduction must be incor-
porated into the time-span reduction well-formedness rules in order to
“undo” the effects of retaining two elements at once.

Though the subordination of the dominant to the final is uncontro-
versial in the case of a full cadence, one might question whether it is
appropriate for a deceptive cadence, where the final is harmonically less
stable than the penult. Since less stable events are in general subordinate
to more stable ones (see section 7.3), one might want to reverse the
dependency of the cadential elements here. However, such a reversal
would lose the intuition that the vi of the deceptive cadence is perceived
as the rhythmic goal of the phrase. We propose instead that the structural
difference between full and deceptive cadences appears only in prolonga-
tional reduction, where conditions of pitch stability and connection over-
ride rhythmic considerations. Thus the musical character of a deceptive
cadence arises from the disparity between its rhythmic and harmonic
endings. (See section 9.4 for further discussion.)

Final Statement of Time-Span Reduction Well-Formedness Rules

TSRWER 1 For every time-span T, there is an event e (or a seguence of
events e,e:) that is the bead of T.

TSRWER 2 If T does not contain any other time-span (thatis, if Tis at
the smallest level of time-spans), then e is whatever event occurs in T.
