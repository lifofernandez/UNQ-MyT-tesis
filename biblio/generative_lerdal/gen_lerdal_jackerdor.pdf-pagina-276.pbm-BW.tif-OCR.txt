102-—104 are transitional.) Moreover, the F major chord in measure 106
and the motivic extensions off it (measures 106—116) form successively
embedded right branches (destabilizing departures) corresponding to
measures 1-4 of 10.15. This is balanced by the successively embedded
left branches (stabilizing progressions; the descending circle of fifths) of
the second part of the development, which correspond to measures 5—8
of 10.15. In sum, the development section, beneath its chromatic com-
plexities, is not only a motivic expansion of the opening phrase but also
an elaboration of its prolongational tree.

The analogy falters with respect to the central F4 minor section of the
development (measures 117-—124). As the sketch in 10.18 of the time-
span reduction of the development shows, the half cadence in measure
119 and the F minor arrival in measure 123 are time-span globally
important events. (The cadence in measure 119 dominates the cadence in
measure 121 because the latter is a prolongational extension of the
former (TSRPR 6).) As a consequence of the grouping structure, the ca-
dence (measure 119) is a right branch in the time-span reduction and the
F minor arrival is a left branch. Because of their structural importance,
these two events must also be prolongationally important (PRPR 1). So
far the analogy succeeds. But in the prolongational reduction these events
cannot connect as right and left branches, respectively, because they and
the other events in measures 117-124 form among themselves a powerful
prolongational region (PRPR 3) (10.17). Hence this region is prolonga-
tionally isolated from the embedded right and left branching patterns
described above.
