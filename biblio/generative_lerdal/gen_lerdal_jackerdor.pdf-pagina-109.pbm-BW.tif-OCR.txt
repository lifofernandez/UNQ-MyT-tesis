Although the concept of reduction is familiar in current musical analysis,

Besides aiding those readers not familiar with the notion, this discussion
may help to ground it in ordinary experience and clarify what claims we
are and are not making.

An obvious observation about music is that some musical passages are
heard as ornamented versions, or elaborations, of others. For instance,
despite the surface differences in pitches and durations berween examples
5.1a and 5.1b, from the finale theme of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony,
the listener has no difficulty in recognizing 5.1b as an elaboration of 5.1a.

 

 

 

 

The inverse of elaboration also occurs, for example when a popular song
is played in “stop time” to accompany a tap dancer. Despite the fact that
the “stop time” version has fewer notes in it and the notes are in different
rhythmic relationships, the listener readily accepts it as a version of the
song.

More complex is the situation where two or more passages are both
heard as elaborations of an abstract structure that is never overtly stated.
Bach's Goldberg Variations is a particularly magnificent example of this
kind of organization. Why is the listener able to recognize, beneath the
seemingly infinite variety of its musical surface, that the aria and 30
variations are all variations of one another? Why do they not sound like
