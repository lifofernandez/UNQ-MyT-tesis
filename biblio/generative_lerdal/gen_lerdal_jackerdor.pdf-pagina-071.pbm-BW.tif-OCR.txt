Little comment on this example is necessary. The total repetition of
phrases is of course the strongest form of parallelism. The smallest
groups group by twos with adjacent groups of equal length; these inter-
mediate groups again group by twos with groups of equal length. Fur-
thermore, the intermediate-level boundaries are marked by both rests and
greater duration between attack points, whereas the less important
boundaries are marked only by the latter distinction, and to a lesser
degree. Thus the rules of intensification, symmetry, and parallelism are
all simultaneously satisfied by the grouping suggested by the local evi-
dence; there is no ambiguity or vagueness. In addition, the grouping is
maximally in phase with the meter, in the sense discussed in section 2.3,
and this contributes to the stability of the analysis.

Many folk songs and nursery rhymes also exhibit this sort of regularity
in the application of grouping preference rules. Pieces of this sort are
often thought of as having “stereotypical” grouping structure, which in
terms of the present theory means maximal reinforcement of grouping
preference rules. And here lies a danger for research. Some attempts at a
generative description of music (such as Sundberg and Lindblom 1976)
have treated such stereotypical grouping structures as basic and assumed
they could be extended to more complex structures. Furthermore, be-
cause the grouping is in phase with the meter, Sundberg and Lindblom
make the same mistake as Komar 1971 (discussed in section 2.2): group-
ing is confused with large-scale metrical structure. If the present theory is
correct, however, the stereotypical structures are totally unrevealing,
since they represent the confluence of a great number of interacting fac-
tors whose individual effects therefore cannot be identified. It is essential
to begin with more sophisticated examples in order to arrive at any
notion of what is going on.
