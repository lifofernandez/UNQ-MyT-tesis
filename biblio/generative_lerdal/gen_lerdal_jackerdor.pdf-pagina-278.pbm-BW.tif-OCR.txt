changes in the music such as converting 10.15 into 10.19 would involve
an extensive use of transformational rules (TSRWFRs 3b and 3c are in
effect transformational rules). This is a direction we have so far avoided
because of the difficulty in constraining the application of such rules.
Moreover, it is dangerous in a theory of musical intuition to alter the
musical surface too much in the pursuit of a coherent underlying model;
one can lose touch with the actual music. We have found it method-
ologically prudent to err in the direction of adhering to musical surfaces
as the basis for assigning hierarchical descriptions. Third, it is hard to
arrive at general principles for the determination of primary, subsidiary,
and “contrapuntal” lines. This is obviously a significant area of musical
intuition, and it plays a crucial role in the perception of underlying voice
leading. We have not explored this area in any detail.

Assuming that these problems can be overcome, we surmise that the
assignment of “coherent” voice-leading structures will take place not as a
last step in prolongational derivation, but at various stages of time-span
and prolongational derivation. These transformational operations, of
course, will apply only where cognitively meaningful. To the degree that
such operations will be needed for a given musical passage, the listener's
task of comprehending the musical signal will naturally be seen to be
much more complicated.

The second enhancement of the prolongational component concerns a
partial separation of melodic from harmonic reductional function. As
stated in section 5.3, a purely hierarchical approach to pitch structure
demands that a piece be viewed as a sequence of discrete events. Each
