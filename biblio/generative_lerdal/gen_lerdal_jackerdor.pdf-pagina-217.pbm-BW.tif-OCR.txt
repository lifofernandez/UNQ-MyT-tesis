Prolongational Hypothesis 1 raises a crucial question: how are the
hierarchical regions in a piece defined? For example, how does one arrive
at the difference in the regions appropriate to the hearing of 9.1a and
9.1b? In effect, this was the question asked in section 5.4, where we
demonstrated the impossibility of reducing a piece on the basis of the
surface sequence of pitch-events alone. As suggested in section 8.2, the
answer we propose can be stated as the following hypothesis:

Prolongational Hypothesis 2 The choice of events that define prolonga-
tional regions is strongly influenced by the relative importance of events
in the time-span reduction.

Prolongational Hypothesis 1 claims that it is possible to build a tree
structure; it thus enters into the formulation of the prolongational reduc-
tion well-formedness rules, to be stated in the next section. Prolonga-
tional Hypothesis 2, on the other hand, deals with the question of which
of the many possible tree structures assigned to a piece by the well-
formedness rules represents one's actual hearing. It claims that the major
axes of tension and relaxation tend to be those events that are most
important in articulating grouping structure. This hypothesis, with a
number of refinements, will be incorporated into the prolongational re-
duction preference rules, to be developed in section 9.4.

To define prolongational tree structures over pieces, we need four rules.
First, the tree must contain a single most important event, the head.
Second, there must be specified ways for events to elaborate other events.
√Ås discussed in section 8.1, these are strong prolongation, weak prolon-
gation, and progression. Third, every event in the piece must be attached
to the tree. Fourth, branches must not cross. It is the latter two conditions
that embody Prolongational Hypothesis 1, guaranteeing the hierarchical
embedding of prolongational regions.

For precision, We must state over What string of pitch-events the pro-
longational reduction is defined. If it is defined over the musical surface,
we will be unable to supply two separate functions to those events con-
tained in a grouping overlap. This suggests that the prolongational reduc-
tion, like the time-span reduction, should be defined over underlying
grouping structure. A further refinement would take account of the extra
events present in the time-span reduction that are created by fusion and
transformation, since they too have functions in the prolongational re-
duction. However, we leave their incorporation into this component for
future research and assume for the moment that the underlying grouping
structure provides the correct string of events from which to construct the
prolongational reduction.

To facilitate formal treatment of the prolongational tree, we introduce
the following definitions:
