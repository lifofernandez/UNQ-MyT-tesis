Musical Universals and Related Issues

This chapter presents a retrospective overview of the theory developed in
chapters 2-9, focusing on the issue of musical universals and their impli-
cations for musical cognition.

To forestall misunderstanding, we should make clear at the outset what
we mean by the term “musical universal.” A musical universal need not
be readily apparent in all musical idioms. We are concerned here rather
with universals of musical grammars—ethe principles available to all
experienced listeners for organizing the musical surfaces they hear, no
matter what idiom they are experienced in. The relation between a mu-
sical universal in this sense and the nature of particular musical idioms is
somewhat subtle and bears explanation.

Each rule of musical grammar is sensitive to certain features of the
musical surface (such as presence of attack points or relatively consonant
pitch events) or to certain aspects of musical structure (for example,
symmetry, parallelism, and stability of other components of the analysis).
If the relevant feature is present, the rule applies to mark a certain struc-
ture as well formed or preferred (depending whether the rule is a well-
formedness or a preference rule). Essentially, we can claim a rule to be
universal f it applies in the same way in every idiom that employs the
distinctions to which the rule is sensitive. For example, we feel fairly
confident that metrical preference rule 4, the stress rule, is universal; we
suspecr that there is no idiom that uses local stresses in which these
stresses do not tend to be heard as strong beats, other things being equal.
In particular, there is no idiom in which stresses are marks of weak beats.

There are two kinds of apparent counterexamples to this claim, both of
which are taken into account in our definition. First, an idiom in which
stresses do not occur (for example, some varieties of Renaissance music)
does not argue against the universality of the rule. The stylistic norms of
