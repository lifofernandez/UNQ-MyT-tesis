Metrical Structure

347

22 begins with event e, and
(for left elision) e, is harmonically identical to e; and less than e, 1n
dynamics and pitch range or
(for right elision) e, is harmonically identical to e, and less than e, in
dynamics and pitch range,
a well-formed surface grouping structure G” may be formed that is iden-
tical to G except that
it contains one event e' where G had the sequence e¡e»,
(for left elision) e' = e»,
(for right elision) e' = e,
all groups ending with e, in G end with e' in G', and
all groups beginning with e; in G begin with e' in G'.

MWER 1 (revised) (p. 72)
Every attack point must be associated with a beat at the smallest metrical
level present at that point in the piece.

MWER 2 (revised) (p. 72)
Every beat at a given level must also be a beat at all smaller levels present
at that point in the piece.

MWER 3* (p. 69)

At each metrical level, strong beats are spaced either two or three beats
apart.

MWER 4 (revised)* (p. 72)

The tactus and immediately larger metrical levels must consist of beats
equally spaced throughout the piece. At subtactus metrical levels, weak
beats must be equally spaced between the surrounding strong beats.

MPR 1 (Parallelism) (p. 75)
Where two or more groups or parts of groups can be construed as paral-
lel, they preferably receive parallel metrical structure.

MPR 2 (Strong Beat Early) (p. 76)
Weakly prefer a metrical structure in which the strongest beat in a group
appears relatively early in the group.

MPR 3 (Event) (p. 76)
Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L; that coincide with
the inception of pitch-events are strong beats of L;.

MPR 4 (Stress) (p. 79)
Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L; that are stressed are
strong beats of L;.
