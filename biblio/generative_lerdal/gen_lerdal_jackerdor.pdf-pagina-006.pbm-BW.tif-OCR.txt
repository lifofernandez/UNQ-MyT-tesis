In the twentieth century these types of explanations have fallen into
relative disfavor. Two general trends can be discerned. The first is to seek
a mathematical foundation for the constructs and relationships of music
theory. This in itself is not enough, however, because mathematics is
capable of describing any conceivable type of organization. To establish
the basis for a theory of music, one would want to explain why certain
conceivable constructs are utilized and others not. The second trend is to
fall back on artistic intuition in constructing a theory, essentially ignoring
the source of such intuition. But this approach too is inadequate, because
it severs questions of art from deeper rational inquiry; it treats music as
though it had nothing to do with any other aspect of the world.

All of these approaches downplay the obvious fact that music is a
product of human activity. It is worth asking at the outset what the
nature of this product is. It is not a musical score, if only because many
musical traditions are partially or completely unwritten.? It is not a per-
formance, because any particular piece of music can receive a great vari-
ety of performances. Music theory is usually not concerned with the
performers” activities, nor is it concerned centrally with the sound waves
the performers produce. There is much more to music than the raw
uninterpreted physical signal.

Where, then, do the constructs and relationships described by music
theory reside? The present study will justify the view that a piece of music
is a mentally constructed entity, of which scores and performances are
partial representations by which the piece is transmitted. One commonly
speaks of musical structure for which there is no direct correlate in the
score or in the sound waves produced in performance. One speaks of
music as segmented into units of all sizes, of patterns of strong and weak
beats, of thematic relationships, of pitches as ornamental or structurally
important, of tension and repose, and so forth. Insofar as one wishes to
ascribe some sort of “reality” to these kinds of structure, one must ulti-
mately treat them as mental products imposed on or inferred from the
physical signal. In our view, the central task of music theory should be to
explicate this mentally produced organization. Seen in this way, music
theory takes a place among traditional areas of cognitive psychology such
as theories of vision and language.

This perspective sheds a different light on the two recent theoretical
trends mentioned above. On the one hand, in principle it offers an em-
pirical criterion for limiting mathematical formulations of musical struc-
ture; not every conceivable organization of a musical signal can be
perceived by a human listener. One can imagine some mathematical
relationship to obtain berween every tenth note of a piece, but such a
relationship would in all likelihood be perceptually irrelevant and mu-
sically unenlightening. On the other hand, this approach takes artistic
intuition out of isolation and relates it to mental life in general. It be-
comes possible to explain artistically interesting aspects of musical
