After the V$ attaches, the I attaches as a weak prolongation to the
initial I. The tree now looks as in 9.15.

92.15

 

Between the V* and the second I, the most time-span-important event
is the “vi7.” But the second V* forms more stable prolongational connec-
tions, either as a strong prolongation of the first V* or as a progression
into the second I by descending circle of fifths. In either case, the Interac-
tion Principle allows us to choose the V*, despite its lesser time-span
importance; this yields 9.16. -

The dashed lines in 9.16 indicate the alternative atrachments of the sec-
ond V*. We believe the choice is a genuine ambiguity in the piece: Is this
event heard as a repetition of the first V* (branching a), or as leading into
the I (branching b)? Note, however, that PRPRs 2 and 4 both favor
branching », because the I and the second V* but not the first V$ are in
the second two-measure group and because the l is more important than
the V*. For this reason, there may be some preference for this attachment.

Between the two V%s, the most time-span-important event is still the
“vi7,” while the strongest harmonic connection is to the V3. As in 9.15,
however, linear and harmonic connections conflict, leaving PRPR 1 free
to choose the “vi7” as ex. If branching a in 9.16 is preferred, there is
pressure for the “vi7” to attach to the previous V% because of PRPR 4. If
branching b is selected, the “vi7” artaches unequivocally to the following
