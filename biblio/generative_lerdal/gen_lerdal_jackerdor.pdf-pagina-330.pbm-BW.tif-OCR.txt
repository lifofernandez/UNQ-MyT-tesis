music and language in this respect is that musical events are organized
around a fixed and regular metrical structure that must be maintained
throughout. In language, by contrast, the rhythm is flexible and is not
required to conform to any particular pattern.

Either of these practices may be altered. In recitative, fixed meter is
abandoned by dropping MWEFR 3 (the spacing of strong beats two or
three beats apart) and MWEFR 4 (the equal spacing of beats), and more
flexible, speechlike rhythms appear. In poetry, a fixed metrical pattern is
imposed to which the linguistic stresses correspond; in effect, a counter-
part of MWERs 3 and 4 1s adopted (see Halle and Keyser 1971 and
Kiparsky 1977 for discussion).

Thus we can conclude that the relation of relative prominence to met-
rical structure is substantially the same in music and language. The dif-
ference between the relevant musical preference rules and the prosodic
Rhythm Rule is a function largely of the different metrical practices of the
two media.

Some Discrepancies

The last three subsections have shown that time-span reduction and pro-
sodic structure are not just represented by equivalent tree notation; they
are the products of grammars that carry out formally parallel operations
on musical and phonological strings. In each case, the string is segmented
into a layered hierarchy, in which each layer provides an exhaustive
segmentation. A set of possible tree structures is defined in precisely
parallel fashion over the segmentations, and preference rules or promi-
nence rules determine which of the possible trees is the correct one.
Furthermore, two substantive parallels have appeared: the treatment of
augmented time-spans and augmented feet, with group boundaries and
word boundaries playing equivalent roles; and the relationship of metri-
cal structure to choices made by the prominence rules.

Of course, the nature of the strings being segmented and most of the
substance of the rules in the two theories are quite different. This only
serves to make the formal parallels still more striking, particularly since
the two theories were developed independently and were designed to
account for radically different sorts of intuitions (though there has been
interfertilization of the two theories with respect to the treatment of
metrical structure). Before drawing further conclusions, however, we
should consider some formal respects in which the two theories differ and
discuss how the differences might be resolved.

First, although the parallelism was first motivated by the equivalence
of the tree notations, the two notations actually differ somewhat in ex-
pressive power. Our discussion has shown the equivalence of prosodic
trees to the plainest form of time-span trees, where only ordinary reduc-
tion has taken place. But in section 7.2 we showed that there are three
other relationships that can obtain between the head of a time-span and
