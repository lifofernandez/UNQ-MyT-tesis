there is an event for each span at the level in question. Diagrams 6.6c—
6.6e complete the branching possibilities: ¡f event x dominates, y and z
attach to it equally; and similarly if y or 2 dominates. (See section 12.3 on
the possibility of restricting time-span trees to binary branching.)

At local levels, as we have just seen, metrical structure determines
time-span structure. Thus we can relate right and left branching to metri-
cal structure in a musically significant way. In 6.7 two levels of metrical
structure and time-span segmentation have been indicated, to produce,
along with the two kinds of branching, four paradigmatic situations.

Cases a and b pertain to afterbeats: in a, event y on the afterbeat is the
less stable event, as in the case of a passing or neighboring tone or chord;
in », event x on the downbeat is the less stable event, as in the case of a
suspension or an appoggiatura tone or chord. Cases c and d pertain to
upbeats: in c, event x on the upbeat is the less stable event; in d, event y
on the downbeat is the less stable event. Viewed differently, the more
stable events in a and c occur on strong beats, and those in b and d occur
on weak beats. (These distinctions function for ternary branching as
well.)

Á time-span reduction of local levels of the first two phrases of Bach's
chorale “O Haupt Voll Blut und Wunden” will illustrate these pitch-
meter relationships. Example 6.8 presents the time-span segmentation.
