Time-span reduction cannot express the structural relationships
sketched in 5.14 because it is constrained in its selection of significant
events by the time-span segmentation established by the metrical and
grouping analyses. It chooses single events over more or less equal time-
spans, that is all. Thus, in 5.11, only one event (the I chord) can be
selected within the span of the first half of measure 4, with the result that
the syntactically essential ii* is assigned less structural importance than,
say, the merely arpeggiated Ví in measure 2. And at the span of the
measure, the I in measure 4, even though it is heard as a significant
prolongation of the opening sonority, must give way to the cadential V,
while in measures 2—3 neighboring events remain. If, as often happens,
events of equivalent structural importance were to unfold at a regular
rate, one per time-span, these particular difficulties would not emerge.
But here—and this often happens, too—the structural action of the
phrase is delayed until the fourth bar, where it precipitates all at once.
Time-span reduction is not equipped to handle such situations.

Example 5.14 also suggests a “psychological” interpretation that sheds
more light on the limitations of time-span reduction. One might say that
the phrase begins in relative repose, increases in tension (second half of
measure 1 to the downbeat of measure 3), stretches the tension in a kind
of dynamic reversal to the opening (downbeat of measure 3 to downbeat
of measure 4), and then relaxes the tension (the rest of measure 4). It
would be highly desirable for a reduction to express this kind of musical
ebb and flow. Time-span reduction cannot do this, not only because in
such cases as this it derives a sequence of events incompatible with such
an interpretation (5.12 as opposed to 5.14), but because the kind of
information it conveys, while essential, is couched in completely different
terms. It says that particular pitch-events are heard in relation to a par-
ticular beat, within a particular group, but it says nothing about how
music flows across these segments.

It is through such considerations as these that we have been led to the
conception of two independent but interactive reductional components:
time-span reduction and prolongational reduction. Recall that the Strong
Reduction Hypothesis posits a hierarchy of events such that less impor-
tant events are heard in a specified relationship to surrounding more
