not engage those parts of the time-span and prolongational reduction
rules that are sensitive to harmonic stability. One might wonder if there
are universals of musical grammar that are similarly not exploited by
classical Western tonal music and whose presence we have therefore not
suspected here. A study of other idioms would help to reveal the existence
of such principles.

Beyond the specific claims about universality of particular rules dis-
cussed in preceding chapters, we present here some overall hypotheses
about universals that emerge from the theory —general features that re-
main intact beneath any modifications of the rules themselves.

1. Musical intuitions are organized along the four hierarchical dimen-
sions treated here: grouping, metrical structure, time-span reduction,
and prolongational reduction. Each of these (with specified exceptions
such as overlaps) is a strictly hierarchical structure that includes every
pitch-event in a piece.

2. The structure of a piece in each component is determined by the in-
teraction of well-formedness rules, preference rules, and transforma-
tional rules, applying in essentially the way we have illustrated in
previous chapters.

3. The four components interrelate basically in the ways developed here:
a. Grouping and meter are independent (though different ¡idioms con-

strain their interaction in varying degrees).

b. Time-span segmentation depends on meter at small levels, grouping
at large levels, and the combination of the two at intermediate
levels.

c. Time-span reduction depends on a combination of pitch stability
and time-span segmentation.

d. Prolongational regions and prolongational importance are deter-
mined largely in terms of time-span importance and stability of
pitch connection.

As a consequence of b-—d, the listener's understanding of global pitch

structure is strongly influenced by his local segmentation of the mu-

sical surface.

4. In order for hierarchical decisions to be made within the two reduc-
tional components, there must be criteria for the relative stability of
pitch-events. This means that a given idiom must supply both a tonal
center for a piece (not necessarily a tonic as defined in classical Western
tonality, but a center of pitch gravity) and a scale of distance of other
pitch-events from the tonal center.

$. Structural beginnings and endings of groups form significant articula-
tion of a piece's structure; structural endings are marked by conven-
tional formulas (cadences of some kind).

Each of these points is embodied in the form or content of our gram-
mar for classical Western tonal music. The first two specify the overall
