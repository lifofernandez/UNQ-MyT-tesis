Prolongational

Notice that the endpoints of a prolongational region need not attach
directly to one another. Again this 1s illustrated by the region (e4—es).

Given this definition of a prolongational region, we turn to the ques-
tion of how the prolongationally most important event in a region is
chosen. (Henceforth, for convenience, when we refer to an arbitrary
prolongational region (e;—e;) we will understand this to include the cases
Where e; or e; is replaced by %.)

In the above discussion of prolongational regions, we took for granted
the operation of two separate processes: choosing the prolongationally
most important event in a region (e;—e;), and determining whether that
event is an elaboration of e; or of e;. These two problems are addressed
by the prolongational reduction preference rules. As will be seen, some of
the rules deal with only one problem or the other, and some deal with
both.

Influence of Time-Span Reduction

We begin with two preference rules that establish the relation between
prolongational reduction and time-span reduction. The first is an explicit
statement of Prolongational Hypothesis 2, now localized to the choice of
the most important event of a prolongational region:

PRPR 1 (Time-Span Importance) In choosing the prolongationally most
important event e, of a prolongational region (e;—e;), strongly prefer a
choice in which e, 1s relatively time-span-important.

Since PRPR 1 interacts with preferences concerning pitch stability in ways
not to be described until the next subsection, we illustrate it here with
examples in which pitch stability does not play a role.

An obvious application of PRPR 1 is in choosing the prolongational
head of a piece. If we regard the entire piece as a prolongational region
(4—4t), PRPR 1 says to prefer a prolongational head that is relatively time-
span-important—that is, the time-span head.

Next, recall the impossibility of constructing a reduction of the first
phrase of the Mozart A Major Sonata solely on the basis of pitch criteria
(see example 5.10). There are four root-position tonic chords with C£ on
top, any of which, on pitch criteria alone, might be prolongationally most
important. However, PRPR 1 says that the time-span importance of the
first chord in the piece establishes its prolongational importance; the
relative time-span unimportance of the other three disqualifies them.

A third illustration of PRPR 1 appears in 9.5 (a repetition of 8.8). In
each case, the rule selects the I chord that is in a metrically stronger
position, hence more important in time-span reduction (by TSRPR 1).
