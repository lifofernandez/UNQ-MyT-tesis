An event e; is a direct elaboration of another event e; if e;s branch
terminates on e;'s branch.

An event e; is a recursive elaboration of another event e; if it is a direct
elaboration of e; or if its branch leads upward through a sequence of
direct elaborations to e;s branch.

Figure 9.2 illustrates these terms with an abstract tree structure whose
branches are numbered.

9.2

In 9.2, e; and e; are direct elaborations of e,, Which is in turn a direct
elaboration of es. Hence e, and e are recursive elaborations of both e,
and es. And e, Which is a direct elaboration of e3, is therefore a recursive
elaboration of es, e 1, and es. On the other hand, e; is not a recursive
elaboration of e,: it branches from es, Which does not branch from e.
Similarly, e; is not a recursive elaboration of es.

With these definitions, we can state the prolongational reduction
well-formedness rules.

PRWER 1 Thereis a single event in the underlying grouping structure of
every piece that functions as prolongational head.

PRWER 2 An event e; can be a direct elaboration of another event e; in

any of the following ways:

a. e, is a strong prolongation of e; if the roots, bass notes, and melodic
notes of the two events are identical.

b. e; is a weak prolongation of e; if the roots of the two events are identi-
cal but the bass and/or melodic notes differ.

C. e is a progression to or from e; if the harmonic roots of the two events
are different.

PRWER 3 Every event in the underlying grouping structure is either the
prolongational head or a recursive elaboration of the prolongational

head.
