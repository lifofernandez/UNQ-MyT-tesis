12.3

Can you pass the salt?

May I ask you to pass the salt?
Would you mind passing the salt?

Many principles of pragmatics appear to have the nature of preference
rules. Grice 1975 presents a particularly clear case in which a number of
“maxims” for conversation are stated as preferences on utterances of
sentences; for example, “Make your contribution as informative as re-
quired,” “Do not say what you believe to be false,” “Avoid ambiguity,”
and “Be relevant.” Although these are stated as maxims for the speaker,
they apply equally to the process of interpretation by the hearer, where
they appear as preferences on how to construe the speaker's intended
meaning. In this form, the four maxims just quoted can be stated as in
12.4.

12.4

a. Prefer to assume that the speaker is telling you all he knows.

b. Prefer to assume that the speaker believes what he intends to convey.
c. Prefer to assume that the speaker has only one meaning in mind.

d. Prefer to assume that the speaker is conveying something relevant.

To these must be added the rule whose violation motivates the entire
system:

12.5
Prefer to assume that what the speaker says is what he intends to convey.

The inclusion of “prefer to assume” in all these principles is what
makes them not necessary and sufficient conditions but preferences on
interpretation.

Grice works through a number of cases where the speaker violates
maxims for special effects of various sorts (just as the composer brings
about conflicts among preference rules to avoid clichés in music). The
problem for the hearer is to decide what it is that the speaker intends,
given the context. Just in case the overall demands of the situation call for
rule 12.5 to be overridden, the hearer must construct a plausible intended
message that is in some way related to what is said. Grice calls this
construction a conversational implicature.

Here are a few simple examples: An utterance of an ambiguous sen-
tence presents the hearer with an apparent violation of rule 12.4c. The
rule of relevance 12.4d suggests the proper choice of reading in most
cases, and choosing only one reading (in partial violation of rule 12.5)
permits rule 12.4c to be satisfied. On the other hand, in the case of a pun
both readings are relevant, and 12.4c is abandoned in favor of complete
satisfaction of 12.5, with humorous effect.

Grice presents the case where the speaker says “X is a fine friend,”
where the hearer knows, and the speaker knows that the hearer knows,
