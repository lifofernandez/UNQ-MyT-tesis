Metrical
Well-Formedness
Rules

69

This section first states a simple set of well-formedness rules for metrical
structure in tonal music. It then points out a number of empirical prob-
lems with these rules and suggests how to improve them.

First approximation
The first well-formedness rule establishes the relation of beats to attack
points.

MWER 1 Every attack point must be associated with a beat at the small-
est level of metrical structure.

The second rule establishes the relationship among metrical levels.

MWER 2 Every beat at a given level must also be a beat at all smaller
levels.

Example 4.2a, in which not every note corresponds to a beat, illustrates
a violation of MWER 1. Example 4.2b is a violation of MWER 2; the
second beat on the largest level is not also a beat on the intermediate
level.

 

MWERs 1 and 2 are defining conditions for metrical structures and are
universal. (However, see the next subsection for refinements.)

The other MWFRs define the metrical regularities possible within a
given musical idiom. Since metrical traditions differ, these MWERs are
idiom-specific. Some other idioms are discussed in section 4.4. For classi-
cal Western tonal music, the necessary rules are MWERs 3 and 4.

MWER 3 At each metrical level, strong beats are spaced either two or
three beats apart.

MWER 4 Each metrical level must consist of equally spaced beats.

MWER 3 prohibits analyses like 4.3a, in which strong beats on the
smaller level are six beats apart. In order for the structure to be well-

formed an intermediate level must be added, either as in 4.3b or as
in 4,3c.
