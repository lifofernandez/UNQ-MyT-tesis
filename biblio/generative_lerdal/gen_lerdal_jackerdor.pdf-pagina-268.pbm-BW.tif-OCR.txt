arises that the moment of greatest tension (that is, the most deeply em-
bedded right branch, measure 29), takes place within the elaboration of
the final cadence.

A few words about the secondary notation in 10.11; At level b we have
slightly transformed the outer voice-leading to show the underlying pat-
tern of descending 10ths in measures 4—19. In measures 24—35 we have
added some inner voicing, together with the numbering of scale degrees,
to demonstrate how the melodic line resolves simultaneously on the tonic
in the upper register and on the third in the middle register. (This analysis
corresponds closely to that of Schenker 1932.) Level a shows the overall
basic form and normative structure (with added right prolongation)
(compare 8.28b). It is unusual for these events to spread out so evenly
across an entire piece. This, plus the unarticulated musical surface, gives
the piece the character of a single overarching phrase.

Before turning to the next example, we must interpolate a remark
about harmonic rhythm. As normally conceived, harmonic rhythm is the
pattern of durations produced by changes in harmony at the musical
surface. This conception can easily be deepened by considering it also to
be the pattern of durations created by any given level of prolongational
reduction. For example, the harmonic rhythm of the C Major Prelude is
not just one harmony per bar, but—among other levels—19 bars of 1
(measures 1-19), 3 bars of ii% (measures 21—23, with measure 20 as
transitional), 8 bars of V7 (measures 24-—31), and 4 bars of I (measures
32-35) (level a in the secondary notation in 10.11).

Schubert's song “Morgengruss” also begins its final cadence unusually
early, but in this case the harmonic rhythm of its global normative struc-
ture is so bizarre that one suspects the actual music to be a deviation from
a more prototypical pattern. Before this point can be addressed, however,
we must look at its grouping, metrical, and time-span reductional
analyses (10.12). (In the example, the introduction and strophic repeti-
tions have been omitted. The musicis already reduced to the quarter-note
level. The voice and piano have been compressed into one; the paren-
theses in measures 6—7 and 17-19 indicate the timbrally subordinate
repetitions for piano alone.)

To abbreviate this discussion, let us assume as given the metrical and
time-span reductional analyses. The grouping, however, deserves special
comment. In 10.12 the solid slurs denote the selected groupings, the
dashed slurs alternate possibilities. The first ambiguity concerns the sta-
tus of the piano repetitions in measures 6-7 and 17-—19. Are they exten-
sions of two parallel 6-bar phrases (measures 1—6 and 12—17) (GPR 6),
or are they echoes of immediately preceding material (measures 5—6 and
15-17) (also GPR 6)? Both are true; we have chosen the latrer parallelism
because the former would excessively elevate the piano repetitions in the
time-span reduction (GPR 7).
