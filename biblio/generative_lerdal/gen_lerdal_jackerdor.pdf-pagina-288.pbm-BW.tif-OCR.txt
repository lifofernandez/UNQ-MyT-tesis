periodicity. A special metrical level is designated as the tactus. This
level is the perceptually most salient metrical level; it is regular, and is
usually ar a moderate tempo. At comparatively small and large levels,
metrical irregularities of a limited kind can take place. One kind of
irregularity, metrical deletion, occurs in connection with grouping
overlap, andis treated by a corresponding transformational rule. The
perception of meter fades at global levels.

A group at a small or intermediate grouping level can have a strongest
beat, around which other beats within the group “cluster” (this phe-
nomenon is central to Cooper and Meyer 1960). Whether a weak beat
within the group is heard as an upbeat or as an afterbeat is a function
ofits position in the grouping structure. The time-span from an upbeat
to its associated downbeat is an anacrusis. More generally, the listener
hears as perceptually significant the interaction of grouping structure
with the time-spans from beat to beat at each metrical level. When
these two kinds of temporal articulation coincide, grouping and meter
are ín phase; when they do not, grouping and meter are out of phase.
Out-of-phase patterns can be slight or acute.

. The listener hears pitch-events in the context of rhythmic units com-

posed of a combination of metrical and grouping time-spans. The
segmentation rules develop these rhythmic units in terms of metrical
time-spans at small musical levels, of a combination of metrical and
grouping time-spans at intermediate levels, and of grouping time-spans
at large levels.

.In a broad sense, the function of time-span reduction is to relate

rhythmic structure and pitch structure to each other. It does this by
assigning a hierarchy of structural importance to pitch-events within
rhythmic units as defined by the segmentation rules. At small time-
span reductional levels, right and left branchings convey the relation of
structurally important events to metrical structure. The four pitch-
meter paradigmatic situations of section 6.2 exhaust the relational
possibilities of a head and ts direct elaboration(s) to strong and weak
beats. At large levels (from the phrase up), right and left branchings
signify the dominance and subordination of structural beginnings and
structural endings (cadences) as they function within grouping struc-
ture. Structural beginnings and cadences relate cyclically across groups
at successive levels of global segmentation. These “arcs of tonal mo-
tion” normally begin and end at or near the endpoints of the groups
for which they function, and hence stand in accentual opposition to
the periodicity of metrical structure. Such structural accents can occur
at metrically strong or weak points.

. A structural downbeat represents the instantaneous confluence of a

grouping boundary (often in conjunction with an overlap), a hyper-
metrical strong beat, and a structurally important event in time-span
reduction. A structural anacrusis covers the span from the previous
