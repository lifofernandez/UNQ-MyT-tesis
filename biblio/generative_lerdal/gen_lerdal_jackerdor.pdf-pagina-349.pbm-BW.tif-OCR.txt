Rule Index

Note: Rules marked with an asterisk are idiom-specific. We believe the
rest are universal.

GWER 1 (p. 37)
Any contiguous sequence of pitch-events, drum beats, or the like can
constitute a group, and only contiguous sequences can constitute a

group.
GWER 2 (p. 38)

A piece constitutes a group.

GWER 3 (p. 38)

A group may contain smaller groups.

GWER 4 (p. 38)
lf a group G contains part of a group Gx, it must contain all of Gz.

GWER 5 (p. 38)
If a group G; contains a smaller group G2, then G¡ must be exhaustively
partitioned into smaller groups.

GPR 1, alternative form (p. 43)
Avoid analyses with very small groups—the smaller, the less prefer-
able.

GPR 2 (Proximity) (p. 45)

Consider a seguence of four notes n,7,n37,4. All else being equal, the

transition 7,—n3 may be heard as a group boundary if

a. (Slur/Rest) the interval of time from the end of 1, to the beginning of ;
is greater than that from the end of n to the beginning of 1, and that
from the end of n to the beginning of n,, or if

b. (Attack-Point) the interval of time berween the attack points of 1, and
nzis greater than that berween the attack points of 1, and 1, and that
between the attack points of 13 and n,.
