surrounded by two short notes, as in 3.14c. Thus the rule of proximity
has two cases, designated as a and b in the following statement of
GPR 2.

GPR 2 (Proximity) Consider a seguence of four notes n ,712"13/,. All else

being equal, the transition 7,â€”713 may be heard as a group boundary if

a. (Slur/Rest) the interval of time from the end of n, to the beginning of n
1s greater than that from the end of 7 to the beginning of ; and that
from the end of n to the beginning of ,, or if

b. (Attack-Point) the interval of time between the attack points of 1, and
3 1s greater than that between the attack points of 7, and n and that
between the attack points of 723 and 7,.

It is important to see exactly what this rule says. It applies in 3.14 to
mark a potential group boundary where the caret is marked. However, it
does not apply in cases such as 3.15.

3.15

 

Consider 3.15a. There are two unslurred transitions, each of which might
be thought to be a potential boundary. But since neither of these transi-
tions is surrounded by slurred transitions, as GPR 2a requires, the con-
ditions for the rule are not met and no potential group boundary is
assigned. This consequence of the rule corresponds to the intuition that
grouping in 3.15a is far less definite than in 3.14a, where GPR 2a genu-
inely applies. Examples 3.15b and 3.15c are parallel illustrations of the
nonapplication of GPR 2 when rests and long notes are involved.

Another rule of local detail is a more complete version of the principle
of similarity illustrated in the preceding section. Example 3.16 shows
four cases of this principle; the first of these corresponds to the earlier
examples of similarity.

3.16

 

As in 3.14, the distinctive transitions are heard between the third and
fourth notes. What makes the transitions distinctive in these cases is
change in (a) register, (b) dynamics, (c) pattern of articulation, and (d)
length of notes, We state the rule in a fashion parallel to GPR 2:
