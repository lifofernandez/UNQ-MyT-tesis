and Maury Yeston. We have also received valuable advice from many
colleagues and students. Among the members of the MIT seminar, we
must thank Jeanne Bamberger, Arthur Berger, David Epstein, John Har-
bison, David Lewin, and Irving Singer; among other musicians, Tim
Aarset, Leonard Bernstein, Edward T. Cone, Gary Greenberg, Andrew
Imbrie, Elise Jackendoff, Allan Keiler, Henry Martin, Gregory Proctor,
Paul Salerni, Seymour Shifrin, James Snell, and James Webster; among
linguists and psychologists, Morris Halle, Richard Held, Samuel Jay
Keyser, Edward Klima, James Lackner, George Miller, Alan Prince, and
Lisa Selkirk. Each of these people has contributed something essential to
the content or form of this book. George Edwards and Louis Karchin
read the entire manuscript and made many useful suggestions. The au-
thors blame each other for any errors that remain.

We are also grateful to the School of Humanities at MIT for providing
financial support to the Seminar on Music, Linguistics, and Aesthetics; to
Brandeis University for support toward the preparation of the illustra-
tions; to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for a fellow-
ship to Lerdahl in 1974--75, ostensibly to compose; and to the National
Endowment for the Humanities for a fellowship to Jackendoff in 1978,
ostensibly to write on semantics. For the misuse of funds we can only
apologize, and hope that this extracurricular activity has enriched our
“real” work as much as we think it has.

We are deeply indebted to Allen Anderson for his splendid work in
making our unusually difficult musical examples legible and attractive.

Earlier versions of portions of this book have appeared in the Journal
of Music Theory, The Musical Quarterly, and the volume Music, Mind,
and Brain, edited by Manfred Clynes.
