metrical deletion, this time of a time-span starting with a strong beat as
shown in 4.50.

Examples 4.48 and 4.50 help show what these two kinds of metrical
irregularity have in common. In a situation where two groups are joined
by an overlap or elision, the right group seems invariably to begin with a
strong metrical position in the underlying form. If the left group also ends
with a strong metrical position, as in the Mozart Sonata K. 279 discussed
in section 3.4, a well-formed regular metrical structure can be assigned to
the musical surface without problem. If, however, the left group ends in a
relatively weak metrical position, the conflict in the region of overlap
must be resolved by deleting one or the other of the metrical functions. In
4.47 the weak position has been deleted, in a manner consistent with the
elision of the associated pitch-events; in 4.49 the strong position has been
deleted.

In formalizing a transformation rule for metrical deletion, it is not
sufficient to delete the strong or weak beat itself. Notice in 4.48 and 4.50
that a number of beats at a smaller metrical level have also been deleted
to regularize the pattern. This will be included in the statement of the
rule. The rule as stated here encompasses the two types of metrical dele-
tion observed above.

Metrical Deletion, first version From a well-formed metrical structure M

as described by MWFRs 1—4, in which B 1, Bs, and B are adjacent beats

at level L;, and Byis also a beat at level L;,, (thatis, a strong beat of level

L:), another well-formed metrical structure M' can be created by deleting

from M either

a. B, and all beats at all levels between B, and Bs (deletion of weak
position), or

b. B, and all beats at all levels between B, and B; (deletion of strong
position).

It can be seen that cases a and b are deletions of the sort illustrated in
examples 4.47 and 4.49 respectively.

This version of the rule does not mention the connection with grouping
elision and overlap. The rule can be made more specific as follows:
