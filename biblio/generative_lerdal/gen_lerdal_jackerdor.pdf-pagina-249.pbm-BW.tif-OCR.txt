There appears to be a difference in the prolongational behavior of
these two V functions. As seen in previous examples, the cadential V can
function as either a departure from or a progression to a I, depending on
circumstances. But a tonicized V, like other alternative key areas, is heard
more naturally as a departure from a preceding I than as a step in relax-
ing to a following I. This distinction might be incorporated as a refine-
ment in the stability conditions for prolongational connection in order to
reinforce the choice of 9.31a over 9.31b. (It would be invoked in binary
form as well, reinforcing the structure in 9.28c over other alternatives.)

With the division of the piece by the central dominants, there are now
three regions to consider. We deal with the development first. The end of
the development attaches either as a prolongation of the beginning of the
development or as a progression to the recapitulation. The two possibili-
ties are shown with dashed lines in 9.32.
