This completes the discussion of the time-span reduction preference
rules, which take into account local rhythmic considerations (TSRPR 1),
local harmonic considerations (TSRPR 2), local pitch extremes (TSRPR 3),
parallelism (TSRPR 4), metrical and prolongational stability across time-
spans (TSRPRs $ and 6), the presence of cadences (TSRPR 7), the impor-
tance of early structural beginnings (TSRPR 8), and the overall structure
of the piece (TSRPR 9).

This chapter has gone a long way toward providing a principled ac-
count of what the experienced listener must know in order to sense the
relative structural importance of events in a musical surface. In partic-
ular, the rules of time-span reduction provide the crucial link between
local rhythmic and pitch detail and the notions of structural accent cru-
cial to any theory of large-scale musical structure.

We end the chapter with some speculation about musical universals.
One important way in which musical idioms differ is in the principles of
relative pitch stability. Here we have simply assumed the pitch principles
of classical Western tonal music; the relation of these to other tonal
systems will be discussed briefly in section 11.5. Insofar as the principles
of pitch stability play a role in the preference rules for harmonic stability
(TSRPR 2), linear progression (TSRPR 6), and retention of cadences
(TSRPR 7), their influence on time-span reduction is pervasive. On the
other hand, it seems possible that the preference rules themselves are
universal— for example, that TSRPR 2 says to prefer harmonically stable
events as head no matter how the idiom chooses to define harmonic
stability.

There is no problem extending the segmentation rules and the well-
formedness rules to any idiom that is as highly structured in both
grouping and meter as classical Western tonal music. (We did, however,
mention one possible variant of the segmentation rules in section 7.1, in
which regular subgroups include a weak beat preceding rather than fol-
lowing a strong beat.) However, in an idiom where meter is largely
absent, one could not necessarily build time-span structure up to the
group level using meter as we have done here. Similarly, ¡f grouping in
some idiom were not as strongly hierarchical as in classical Western tonal
music, time-span segmentation as we have defined it might not be highly
structured enough at larger levels to permit meaningful decisions about
the relative global importance of events. However, even tentative conclu-
sions about cross-idiom variation in time-span reduction require far
deeper investigation than do grouping and meter, so we hesitate to specu-
late further.
