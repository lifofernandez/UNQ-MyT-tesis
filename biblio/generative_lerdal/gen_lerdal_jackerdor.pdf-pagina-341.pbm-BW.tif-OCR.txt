5. The applications of MPR Se at beats 2, 6, and 10 seem to have something to do
with the rhythmic restlessness of the theme at a very local level. Notice that the
second half of the quoted passage, where the pitch repetitions reinforce rather
than contradicr other metrical preference rules, seems rhythmically more stable.

6. The pervasiveness of certain standard accompanimental patterns can in part
be explained as a reinforcement of MPR 6: the “oom-pah-pah” pattern
(1) naturally expresses 3/4, and the Alberti bass (11) not only places the lowest note
on the first 16th bur places the second-lowest note on the third 16th, that is, on
the metrically intermediate beat within the parrern.

7. The distincrion between this rule and the parts of MPR $ (length) thar make use
of time-span reduction needs some clarification. In the length rule, levels of
time-span reducrion smaller than the metrical level currently being derived help
define whar counts as a repeated pitch or prolonged harmony. In MPR 9, by
contrast, hypotheses about metrical strucrure are tested for their consequences for
levels of time-span reduction equivalent to and larger than the metrical level
currently being derived; a more stable time-span outcome affects metrical choice.

8. The question arises as to why the harmonic changes could not be assigned to
the eighth notes immediately preceding the chords on the eighth-note metrical
level. To answer this objection, we would argue that harmonic progression 1s not
heard as significant ar metrical levels smaller than the tactus, which at the speed
this passage is performed ( J') = at least 240) turns out to be the quarter-note
level. Thus MPR Sf (harmonic rhythm) is properly restricred in applicarion to
harmonic changes in the rime-span reduction ar the tactus level and higher,
eliminating the potentially offending applicarions at bears 5, 11, 17, and 23. (This
restriction eliminates the applications of MPR Sf below the half-nore level in the
derivation of the Mozart G Minor Symphony above. Because of the other metri-
cal evidence, this does not change the derivation.)

2. In Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977 we spoke of metrical overlaps rather than
metrical deletions. As Andrew Imbrie has pointed out (personal communicarion),
beats are points in rime and hence cannot overlap—as opposed to groups, which
have duration. Hence the terminology is changed.

10. This analysis follows the metrical interpretation given in Lerdahl and Jacken-
doff 1977. In another interpretation, where the downbeats of odd-numbered bars
are stronger than those of even-numbered bars, this metrical irregularity does not
occur.

1. See for example the brief remarks by Babbitt (1965, 1972) on these parallels.
Briefly: If one downplays the Hegelian and Romanric sides of Schenker's thought
and emphasizes 1ts more systematic aspects, Schenker can be construed (especially
in Der freie Satz) as having developed a proto-generative theory of tonal
music—hat 1s, as having postulated a limited set of principles capable of recur-
sively generating a potentially infinite set of ronal pieces. Burt, remarkable and
precursory though his achievement was, he did not develop a formal grammar in
the sense one would expect nowadays of a generative theory. Moreover, his
