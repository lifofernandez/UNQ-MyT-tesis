and the length rule in meter (MPR 5). Their behavior will be made clearer
in the course of the derivations in this chapter and chapter 10.

In addition to PRPR 3, there is a second principle that relates prolonga-
tional attachment to prolongational connections. Section 8.2 motivated
this principle in connection with passing and neighboring motions (ex-
amples 8.11 and 8.12).

PRPR 4 (Prolongational Importance) Let e; be the prolongationally
most important event in a region (e;â€”e;). Prefer a prolongational reduc-
tion in which ex is an elaboration of the prolongationally more important
of the endpoints.

This rule, like PRPR 2, affects only the attachment of ex, not the choice of
ex, and like PRPR 2 it is a relatively weak principle in comparison to
PRPRs 1 and 3 (the major factors in determining the details of prolonga-
tional reduction).

Example 8.12d, reproduced here as 9.10, is a case where PRPR 2
conflicts with PRPR 4.

9.10
% T7

The initial event and the neighboring motion are contained in a time-span
that does not contain the downbeat, so PRPR 2 favors a right-branching
construction. Insofar as our judgment of the structure of 9.10 is correct,
PRPR 4 has overridden PRPR 2 here. The delicacy of the judgment may
reflect a balance between the two rules.

Parallelism

As in the other components of the musical grammar, there is a preference
rule for parallelism in prolongational reduction. Imagine an example in
which the stability conditions are in conflict, creating an ambiguity be-
tween right and left branching for a particular event. The parallelism rule
says that no matter how the ambiguity is resolved, parallel passages must
resolve it in the same way. Other things being equal, a motive should not
have a different prolongational structure when it reappears.

PRPR 5 (Parallelism) Prefer a prolongational reduction in which parallel
passages receive parallel analyses.
