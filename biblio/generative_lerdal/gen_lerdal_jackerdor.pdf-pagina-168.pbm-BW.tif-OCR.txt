not to take the D rather than the B as most important in the second
measure. More elaborate examples could be cited, but this simple case
seems sufficient to make the point.

TSRPR 4 (Parallelism) If two or more time-spans can be construed as

motivically and/or rhythmically parallel, preferably assign them parallel
heads.

We next examine a point in K. 331 that appears to be a counter-
example to the interaction of preference rules proposed so far. The time-
span reduction of the first four measures proceeds straightforwardly to
the dotted-quarter level (7.20a). At the next level, however, the intu-
itively most important event in the third measure is the “vi7” rather than
the V$; that is, the reduction from 7.20a should be 7.20b rather than
7.20c.

In all other cases we have seen up to this point, harmonic stability has
been sufficient to override metrical position. Yet in this case the highly
unstable chord in strong metrical position has managed to override the
more stable chord in weak metrical position. This suggests that one or
more additional preference rules must apply here, adding strength to the
analysis in 7.20b.

We discern two principles at work in this example, having to do with
harmonic rhythm and linear bass motion. Consider first harmonic
rhythm. In 7.20b the harmony changes in every measure, whereas in
7.20c it does not change in the third measure and it only changes by
inversion in the fourth. In other words, the harmonic rhythm in 7.20c is
syncopated with respect to the metrical structure. If the difference in
