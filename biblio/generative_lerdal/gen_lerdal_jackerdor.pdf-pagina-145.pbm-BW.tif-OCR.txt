Second, to take a large class of instances, how are we to analyze pieces
in the minor mode? Many passages in the minor mode move to III rather
than V for the intermediate cadence (think, for example, of the main
theme of the second movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony). This
rules out parallel treatment across the two modes if the intermediate V is
selected in the major mode as the structural dominant. Surely one would
not want to assign opposing trees to structural accents in the minor and
major modes, especially when they are otherwise formally parallel. By
contrast, the final cadence in the minor mode cannot be a III-—i progres-
sion. That the final cadence in the minor mode must be V-i points to the
real location of the structural dominant in the major mode.

A final argument against choosing an intermediate V as the structural
dominant is that this would create an unfavorable prolongational reduc-
tion. In the Mozart K. 331 passage, for example, it would suggest that
the V in measure 4 prolongs across the repeat of the opening (measure
5) to the V in measure 8 (6.23a) rather than that the opening I prolongs
across the half cadence to the repeat of the opening (6.23b). It seems
to us essential that the latter relationship obtain. (See section 8.3 for
discussion.)
