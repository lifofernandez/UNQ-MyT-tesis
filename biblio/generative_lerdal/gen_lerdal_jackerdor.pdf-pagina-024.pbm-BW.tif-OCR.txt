Observe that the beats in 2.7a are equally spaced not only at the
smallest level but at larger levels as well. This, the norm in tonal music,
provides what might be called a “metrical grid” in which the periodicity
of beats is reinforced from level to level. Because of the equal spacing
between beats at any level, it is convenient to refer to a given level by the
length of its time-spans— for example, the “quarter-note level” and the
“dotted-half-note level.” As in 2.8, we indicate this labeling of metrical
levels by showing the appropriate time-span note value to the left of each
level.

An important limitation on metrical grids for classical Western tonal
music is that the time-spans berween beats at any given level must be
either two or three times longer than the time-spans between beats at the
next smaller level. For example, in 4/4 (2.7a) the lengths of time-spans
multiply consistently by 2 from level to level; in 3/4 (2.8a) they multiply
by 2 and then by 3; in 6/8 (2.8b) they multiply by 3 and then by 2.

It is interesting to see how the three restrictions on grouping hierar-
chies— nonoverlapping, adjacency, and recursion — ransfer to the very
different formalism of metrical structure. The principle of nonoverlap-
ping prohibits situations such as 2.9a, in which the time-spans from beat
to beat at one level overlap the time-spans from beat to beat at another
level. Rather, a beat at a larger level must also be a beat at all smaller
levels; this is the sense in which meter is hierarchical.

The principle of adjacency means that beats do not relate in some such
fashion as suggested by the arrows in 2.9b; rather, they relate succes-
sively at any given metrical level. The principle of recursion says that the
elements of metrical structure are essentially the same whether at the level
of the smallest note value or at a hypermeasure level (a level larger than
the notated measure). Thus the pattern in 2.7a not only expresses 4/4
meter, but could apply equally to a sequence of 16th notes or a sequence
of downbeats of successive measures. Typically there are at least five or
