For convenience, we repeat here MWERs 1-4 as stated in section 4.1.

MWER 1 Every attack point must be associated with a beat at the small-
est metrical level present at that point in the piece.

MWER 2 Every beat at a given level must also be a beat at all smaller
levels present at that point in the piece.

MWER 3 At each metrical level, strong beats are spaced either two or
three beats apart.

MWER 4 The tactus and immediately larger metrical levels must consist
of beats equally spaced throughout the piece. At subtactus metrical levels,
weak beats must be equally spaced berween the surrounding strong beats.

MWERs 1 and 2 define respectively the association of metrical structure
with a musical surface and the hierarchical nature of metrical structure,
conditions common to all types of music. However, MWERs 3 and 4 are
open to variation. For a simple example, a metrically more rigid idiom
that allowed only duple meters could be characterized by dropping “or
three” from the statement of MWER 3. Alternatively, a much more
loosely structured metrical idiom such as recitativo might be charac-
terized by dropping MWERs 3 and 4 altogether, permitting strong beats
at arbitrarily distant points of articulation. In such an idiom, only local
detail detected by preference rules would determine the location of
beats.

By keeping MWER 3 but dropping MWER 4 we describe a metrical
idiom of considerable irregularity, in that strong beats at each level can
be indiscriminately two or three beats apart. Such structures appear, for
instance, in some of Stravinsky's music—reflected notationally by his use
of constantly changing meters. Note that the lack of rigidity in the metri-
cal structure means that there is no prevailing pattern to which local
details can be set in opposition; rather, strong beats will be heard wher-
ever there are appropriate local details. This predicts thatit will be more
difficult in such a metrical idiom to produce effects of syncopation, which
depend on the conflict of a rigid metrical pattern with local evidence.

Certain other metrical idioms have more complex rules in place of
MWER 4, permitting structured alternation of different-length metrical
units. One such metrical idiom is found in the late sixteenth-century
settings of French vers mesuré by Claude le Jeune. The metrical principle
behind these settings is that the length of notes is determined by accentual
properties of the corresponding syllables: strong syllables receive a half
note and weak syllables a quarter. A brief sample, accompanied by a
plausible metrical structure, is given in 4.44,
