TSRPR 1 (Metrical Position) (p. 160)
Of the possible choices for head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that 1s
in a relatively strong metrical position.

TSRER 2 (Local Harmony) (p. 161)

Of the possible choices for head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that is
a. relatively intrinsically consonant,

b. relatively closely related to the local tonic.

TSRPR 3 (Registral Extremes) (p. 162)

Of the possible choices for head of a time-span T, weakly prefer a choice
that has

a. a higher melodic pitch,

b. a lower bass pitch.

TSRPR 4 (Parallelism) (p. 164)
If two or more time-spans can be construed as motivically and/or rhyth-
mically parallel, preferably assign them parallel heads.

TSRPR $ (Metrical Stability) (p. 165)
In choosing the head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more
stable choice of metrical structure.

TSRPR 6 (Prolongational Stability) (p. 167)
In choosing the head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more
stable choice of prolongational reduction.

TSRPR 7 (Cadential Retention) (p. 170)

If the following conditions obtain in a time-span T, then label the pro-

gression as a cadence and strongly prefer to choose it as head:

1. There is an event or sequence of two events (e,)e; forming the pro-

gression for a full, half, or deceptive cadence.*

il. The last element of this progression is at the end of T or is prolonged
to the end of T.

ili. There 1s a larger group G containing T for which the progression can
function as a structural ending.

TSRPR 8 (Structural Beginning) (p. 170)

lf for a time-span T there is a larger group G containing T for which the
head of T can function as the structural beginning, then prefer as head of
T an event relatively close to the beginning of T (and hence to the begin-
ning of G as well).

TSRPR 9* (p. 174)
In choosing the head of a piece, prefer the structural ending to the struc-
tural beginning.
