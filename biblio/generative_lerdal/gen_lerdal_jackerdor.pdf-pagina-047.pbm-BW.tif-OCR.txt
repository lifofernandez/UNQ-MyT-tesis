Grouping

rules as a rule type is an innovation in the present theory. (More discus-
sion of this general point appears in chapter 12.)

With this background, we turn to stating in some detail the preference
rules for musical grouping.

Two types of evidence in the musical surface are involved in determining
what grouping is heard by an experienced listener. The first is local
detail —the patterns of attack, articulation, dynamics, and registration
that lead to perception of group boundaries. The second type of evidence
involves more global considerations such as symmetry and motivic, the-
matic, rhythmic, or harmonic parallelism. We explore these two types of
evidence in turn.

Local Detail Rules
There are three principles of grouping that involve only local evidence.
The first is quite simple.

GPR 1 Strongly avoid groups containing a single event.

Perhaps the descriptive intent of the rule would be clearer to some readers
if the rule were stated as “Musical intuition strongly avoids choosing
analyses in which there is a group containing a single event” or “One
strongly tends not to hear single events as groups.” Readers who may be
initially uncomfortable with our formulation may find such paraphrases
helpful as they continue through the rules.

The consequence of GPR 1 is that any single pitch-event in the normal
flow of music will be grouped with one or more adjacent events. GPR 1 is
overridden only ¡f a pitch-event is strongly isolated from the adjacent
events, or if for some reason it functions motivically all by itself. Under
the former of these conditions, GPR 1 is overridden by another of the
rules of local detail, which we will state in a moment, Under the latter
condition, GPR 1 is overridden by the preference rule of parallelism, to be
stated as GPR 6. But the comparative rarity of clearly sensed single-note
groups attests to the strength of GPR 1 as a factor in determining musical
intuition. (An example of an isolated note functioning as a group is the
fortissimo C$ in measure 17 of the finale of Beethoven's Eighth Sym-
phony. An example of a single element functioning motivically occurs at
measure 210 of the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony: ele-
ments of the motive have been progressively deleted in the preceding
measures, until at this point one event stands for the original motive.)

An alternative formulation of GPR 1 is somewhat more general. Some
evidence for it will appear in section 3.6.

GPR 1, alternative form Avoid analyses with very small groups—the
smaller, the less preferable.
