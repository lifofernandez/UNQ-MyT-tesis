weak (“feminine” cadence). It says only that, whatever the metrical pat-
tern, the metrical evidence within the cadence should not conflict with the
prevailing global pattern. In particular, when surrounding metrical evi-
dence is in conflict, as in 4.37, MPR 7 implies that the cadence is decisive
in settling on a preferred metrical structure.

From this rule and from MPR 6 follows the traditional principle that
the cadential $ chord should be on a stronger beat than the dominant it
precedes. The bass arrives at the fifth degree of the scale at the % and
maintains it through both chords, so the metrical stability of the bass
with respect to MPR Sa (length of event) requires the stronger beat on the
4. The requirement is particularly stringent because itis within a cadence.

Another place where contrapuntal considerations affect metrical struc-
ture is at suspensions. In tonal music, the examples in 4.38 are heard with
structure ¿ in strong preference to structure ií; that is, the dissonant
suspensions are heard as metrically stronger than their consonant prepa-
rations and resolutions.

4.38

 

In 4.38a this preference is reinforced by MPR 6, since the lower voice
moves to create the dissonance. In 4.38b, by contrast, this preference 1s in
conflict with MPR 6, since the upper voice creates the dissonance and the
bass is suspended; hence the preference for structure ¿ is somewhat
weaker here. Nonetheless, the fact that MPR 6 can be overruled here
demonstrates the need for another preference rule:

MPR 8 (Suspension) Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which a
suspension is on a stronger beat than its resolution.

Finally, we deal with a preference rule alluded to in the previous sub-
section in connection with the larger-level metrical structure in example
4.35. The bass in this passage alternates between G in the upper octave
on beats 3 and 19 and G in the lower octave on beats 11 and 27. The
lower G is sensed to be some indication of a stronger beat on the whole-
note level. To add this effect to the existing rules, one might be tempted
simply to formulate a preference rule favoring lower bass positions.
However, the typical “oom-pah” accompanimental figure (4.39) argues
against such a treatment, since in this example one would hardly be
tempted to hear the lower bass note as the strongest beat.
