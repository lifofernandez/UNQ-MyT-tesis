with grammaticality, music theory is much more concerned with prefer-
ence among a considerable number of competing well-formed (grammat-
ical) structures. The closest analog to linguistic grammaticality in music
theory is adherence to well-formedness rules. These rules resemble lin-
guistic rules in that they either establish a branching or hierarchical struc-
ture (like phrase-structure rules in syntax) or characterize permissible
distortions of the branching structure (like transformations). This sug-
gests that the bulk of a linguistic grammar consists of well-formedness
rules—from phonology through syntax to semantics. Even the lexicon
can be considered a part of the well-formedness rule component, in thatit
establishes well-formed matchings berween phonological, syntactic, and
semantic form at the terminal nodes of branching structures. The well-
formedness rules for music, even considering all four components of the
musical grammar, hardly approach the linguistic well-formedness rules in
complexity. This reflects the much greater role of grammaticality in lan-
guage than in music.

The question thus arises as to whether linguistic theory contains any
rule systems comparable to preference rules in music. It turns out that a
number of phenomena discussed in the linguistic literature have proper-
ties appropriate to such rules. We present three of these briefly.

Relative Scope of Quantifiers

Within the rules relating syntactic form to semantic representation, there
is a subsystem that deals with establishing the correspondence berween
the syntactic position of quantifier words such as every, all, some, and
many and their scope in logical form. The effect of scope difference is
illustrated in the following pair of sentences, discussed in many places in
the linguistic literature. (Emphasizing two languages in example 12.1b
aids interpretation.)

12.1
a. Every person in this room knows at least two languages.
b. At least two languages are known by every person in this room.

In 12.1a each person may know a different two languages, but in 12.1b
two particular languages are known to everyone in the room. The differ-
ence is notated formally in terms of relative embedding of quantifiers; the
“logical forms” of 12.1a and 12.1b are (informally) 12.2a and 12.2b,

respectively.

12.2

a. Every person x in this room is such that [there are two languages y and
z such that [x knows at least y and z]].

b. There are two languages y and z such that [every person x in this room
is such that [x knows at least y and z]].
