and on cs, as in hypothesis C. But this solution is not feasible if one is to
keep the notion of equidistant beats as a defining condition for meter; for
when the next phrase starts, its b is closer to the previous c than each b is
to the c within its own phrase, with the result that the dots at the larger
metrical level are not equally spaced. In sum, hypotheses A and B do
not satisfy the equation of structural and metrical accents, and hypothesis
C does not satisfy the formal or intuitive requirements for metrical
structure.19

Hypothesis C becomes all the more untenable if, as often happens, the
terminating structural accent takes place later in the fourth bar than its
first beat, The opening of Mozart's Sonata K. 331 provides a characteris-
tic instance; if hypothesis C is followed, the resulting “metrical” structure
becomes the pattern shown in 2.20.

Here the two smaller levels follow conventional metrical accentuation,
and the third level of dots represents the initial and cadential structural
accents. This third level not only is wildly irregular in the spacing be-
tween beats, unlike the two smaller levels, but also makes the second
beats of measures 4 and 8 stronger than their first beats. Surely this
cannot be true; it creates havoc with the notion of meter. Hypothesis
C—the equation of structural and metrical accents— must be rejected.

This leaves hypotheses A and B. In both, structural accent can be
regarded as a force independent of meter, expressing the rhythmic energy
of pitch structure across grouping structure. A dogmatic preference for
either hypothesis would distort the flexible nature of the situation; one or
the other—or perhaps something more complicated— pertains in a given
instance. In a broad sense, in-phase passages usually yield hypothesis A
