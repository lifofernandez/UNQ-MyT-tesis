The relevant preference rule is MPR 4,

MPR 4 (Stress) Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level Lithat
are stressed are strong beats of Li.

Note the similarity between MPRs 3 and 4, MPR 3 distinguishes beats
that are inceptions of events from those that are not; MPR 4 distinguishes
beats that have intense inceptions from those that do not, A comparison
of examples 4.14 and 4.18 reveals this similarity: where 4.14 has incep-
tions of events, 4,18 has stresses; and where 4.14 has noninceptions, 4.18
has nonstresses, Thus MPR 4 has the same effect in 4.18 as MPR 3 has
in 4.14. Because of this similarity, we can demonstrate the behavior of
MPR 4 simply by making corresponding substitutions in 4.15 —4,17, Ex-
ample 4.19 corresponds to 4.15, 4.20 to 4.16, and 4,21 to 4.17, (In each
of these MPR 3 applies at every beat, so it makes no differentiation.)?
