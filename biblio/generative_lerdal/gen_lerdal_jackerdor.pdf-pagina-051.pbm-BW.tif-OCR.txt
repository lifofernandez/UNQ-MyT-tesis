are not completely indeterminate. Close consideration suggests that one
probably hears a boundary in 3.18b and 3.18d after the second note, and
in 3.18c after the third note (though contextual considerations such as
parallelism could easily alter these judgments 1f they occurred within a
larger piece). These intuitions can be reflected in the theory by adjusting
the relative strengths of the different cases of GPRs 2 and 3 so that in
these configurations the slur/rest rule (GPR 2a) overrides the attack-point
rule (GPR 2b), the slur/rest rule overrides the register rule (GPR 3a), and
the dynamics rule (GPR 3b) overrides the attack-point rule. In general, all
cases of GPR 3, with the possible exception of the dynamics rule, appear
to have weaker effects than GPR 2. As in the examples in section 3.2,
judgments should change depending on the degree to which different
conditions are satisfied. For example, if the G in 3.18b is lengthened to
four quarters, increasing the disparity in time between attacks, the evi-
dence for the attack-point rule becomes stronger than the evidence for the
slur/rest rule, and the G 1s heard as grouped with the E and the F.

In order to make the theory fully predictive, it might be desirable to
assign each rule a numerical degree of strength, and to assign various
situations a degree of strength as evidence for particular rules. Then in
each situation the influence of a particular rule would be numerically
measured as the product of the rule's intrinsic strength and the strength
of evidence for the rule at that point; the most “natural” judgment would
be the analysis with the highest total numerical value from all rule ap-
plications. We will not attempt such a quantification here, in part for
reasons discussed below. Our theory is nevertheless predictive, even at its
present level of detail, insofar as it identifies points where the rules are
and are not in conflict; this will often be sufficient to carry the musical
analysis quite far. Furthermore, the construction of simple artificial ex-
amples such as those in 3.18 can serve as a helpful guide to the relative
strengths of various rules, and these judgments can then be applied to
more complex cases. We will often appeal to this methodology when
necessary rather than try to quantify rule strengths.?

Before stating the remaining grouping preference rules, let us apply
GPRs 1, 2, and 3 to the opening of Mozart's G Minor Symphony. Besides
illustrating a number of different applications of these rules, this exercise
will help show what further rules are needed. Example 3.19 repeats the
Mozart fragment. For convenience, the notes are numbered above the
staff. Below the staff, all applications of GPRs 2 and 3 are listed as
in 3.18.
