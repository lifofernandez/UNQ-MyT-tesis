musical and linguistic structure. Recent work in phonology has proposed
an analysis of the sound structure of language in terms of hierarchical
structures that resemble time-span reductions. We will show how closely
these phonological structures are formally related to time-span reduc-
tions, then show that they are the result of largely analogous rule systems,
even though the entities the rules manipulate are quite different.

Recall the parallels berween visual and auditory grouping pointed out in
section 3.2 and 3.4. That such parallels exist was observed by Wert-
heimer (1923); KÃ³hler (1929) conjectured that they are a result of simi-
lar physiological organization in the two domains. Lashley (1951) also
argued that essentially similar mental representations serve for both spa-
tially and temporally sequenced memory. However, none of these psy-
chologists had much systematic to say about the structure of temporal
organization per se, beyond the enumeration of a certain amount of
highly suggestive evidence. Having developed a formal theory for one
type of temporal organization, we are in a position to examine the paral-
lelism more closely.

Wertheimer 1923 presents examples almost exactly analogous to our
illustrations of visual and musical grouping in section 3.2 (examples
3.6-3.13), and suggests that three general characteristics are involved in
these judgments: greater proximity and greater similarity enhance group-
ing judgments, judgments are less certain when the principles come into
conflict, and under certain conditions one principle can override the
other. These are exactly the characteristics we have used to motivate the
preference rule formalism. Similar observations with a considerable
number of other principles occur throughout Koffka's (1935) discussion
of shapes, the figure-ground opposition, and three-dimensionality. Wert-
heimer and Koffka demonstrate the influence of such factors as sym-
metry, the continuation of lines along regular curves, the ability of a
pattern to enclose space, and even the viewer's intention. In general, they
state their principles with the same degree of informality that we adopted
in section 3.2; more formal rules like those of section 3.3 do not appear.

The work of Wertheimer and Koffka demonstrates the fundamental
claim of Gestalt psychology: that perception, like other mental activity, is
a dynamic process of organization, in which all elements of the percep-
tual field may be implicated in the organization of any particular part.
They are at pains to point out and prove two crucial aspects of this claim.
First, perception is not simply a product of what is in the environment:
the viewer plays an active, though normally unconscious, part in deter-
mining what he perceives. Second, the totality of the field as perceived
cannot be built up piecemeal as a mere accumulation of the perception of
its parts each taken in isolation.
