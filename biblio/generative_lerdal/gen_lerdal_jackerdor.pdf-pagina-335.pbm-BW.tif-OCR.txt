Given this evidence, one might conclude that the parallel of time-span
reduction and phonology should be explained as follows: Time-span
reduction is an analytic function in musical perception; it is therefore
confined to musically sophisticated listeners; and it is localized in the left
hemisphere, perhaps even in the same place as phonological functions.
We would consider such a conclusion hasty, for at least two reasons.

First, we must take issue with the commonly made dichotomy between
“analytic” and “holistic” processing. It should be obvious from the pres-
ent study that every aspect of musical cognition involves an intricate
interweaving of local and global evidence. Perception of “Gestalt” prop-
erties requires a great deal of “analytic” processing, and vice versa.
Hence the musical evidence suggests that it is more difficult to make a
sharp division berween the functions of the hemispheres along these lines
than has often been thought. One would not expect physiological func-
tions to be any more localized than the corresponding psychological
ones.

Second, we have repeatedly emphasized that the analytic structures we
postulate are not confined to experienced listeners. Even the most naive
listeners undoubtedly hear music as grouped; and they know where to
tap their feet in time to the music, so they have assigned metrical struc-
ture. Moreover, our impression of children's errors in singing songs and
of regional variants of folk songs is thar they reveal intuitions of re-
ductional structure. Typically it seems to be reductionally unimportant
pitches that are omitted or changed, while the structural skeleton remains
intact. We believe, therefore, that differences among listeners concern
how complex and conflicted the structures are that they can handle. This
accords with Bever's (1980, p. 206) assessment that musical sophistica-
tion is actually associated with an advantage in both hemispheres.

Thus we are reluctant to draw any immediate connections between
studies of hemispheric localization and the reduction-phonology parallel.
However, given our conjecture in the preceding subsection that some
form of reductional structure is a more general element in remporal
patterning, we can envisage two distinct hypotheses about brain local-
ization. First, it is possible that all functions involving reductional struc-
ture are localized in the same place. In computational terms, this would
amount to a claim that reduction is a “parameterized subroutine” to
which various processes refer. Alternatively, the parallel could be due to a
conservatism in developing new functions; that is, reductionlike struc-
tures could appear as parts of numerous different capacities and be dif-
ferently localized. Computationally, this would be like saying that many
copies of essentially the same routine are present, each serving different
functions. We are in no position to assess these alternatives. We do think,
however, that the parallelism between the grammars of time-span reduc-
tion and prosodic structure presents an interesting challenge to any gen-
eral theory of mental and neurological processing.
