respect to metrical structure.) We have made no extensive survey of other
tonal idioms, but a preliminary examination suggests three elements that
enter into the definition of a tonal system: a pitch collection or scale, a
member of the pitch collection designated as tonic, and a measure of
relative stability among members of the pitch collection (particularly
with respect to the tonic). Let us consider these in turn.

Pitch Collection

In certain simple tonal systems the pitch collection consists simply of a
given number of distinct pitches, related only by relative height, without
fixed intervals berween them. Some varieties of gamelan music described
in Becker and Becker 1979 have such an organization (though this music
is very complex in other respects). Assuming differentiation among drum
sounds, it is possible to think of drum music in these terms as well.

The next refinementis to specify the intervallic relationships among the
available pitches, as in any number of familiar tonal systems. If the pitch
collection in such an idiom spans more than an octave, two possibilities
appear. First, the upper octave may contain different intervals (or pitch
classes) than the lower; Nettl 1960 (p. 10) cites Cheremis music as an
example of such a system. Alternatively, as in classical Western tonal
music, a principle of octave equivalence may be invoked, so that the pitch
collection extends indefinitely upward and downward by successive oc-
tave transpositions.

Among the options in the definition of pitch collection is the possibility
of contextual variation, such as different pitches in ascending and de-
scending contexts. This is familiar in classical Western tonal music from
the inflection of the sixth and seventh degrees in the minor scale, but 1t
occurs as well in other idioms, for instance in certain Indian ragas
(Cooper 1977).

The specification of pitch collections for classical Western tonal music
might begin with the major and minor diatonic scales, together with their
possible chromatic inflections (in contrast to starting with the chromatic
scale, which does not provide enough internal structure). In addition, a
recursive principle based on the circle of fifths relates the scales by trans-
position. A very different and more complex system appears in raga,
where traditional Indian theory describes the several hundred distinct
thátas, or pitch collections, in terms of relationships to “parent scales.”
Cooper 1977 shows that it is of theoretical interest to treat these relation-
ships as generative principles of some subtlety (see also Powers 1977). To
do so is to claim that the choice of pitch collections is not arbitrary, but
follows from the interaction of simple principles.

Of course, there are many idioms that employ far simpler pitch collec-
tions than the two just mentioned. One would eventually hope to char-
acterize in a constrained way the range of possibilities across “natural”
tonal idioms.
