It is at least an interesting coincidence that two theories, developed
independently to deal with totally dissimilar phenomena, should have
arrived at equivalent notations to express their analyses. To establish a
preliminary sense of the strength of the equivalence, it is useful to com-
pare time-span and prosodic trees with syntactic trees. Both the time-
span and prosodic trees represent a hierarchy of binary oppositions: head
versus elaboration and strong versus weak. By contrast, syntactic trees
represent a hierarchy of abstract syntactic categories, such as sentence,
noun phrase, and verb phrase. Thus the form of time-span and prosodic
trees is not an inevitable consequence of strict hierarchical structure
alone, since there are other imaginable hierarchical organizations that
lead to different types of tree structures,

Does the equivalence of the two notations mean that there is a similar-
ity berween the intuitions the two theories address? As a step toward
answering this question, we Will compare the rule systems that determine
time-span reductions and prosodic trees, and show that they share im-
portant formal properties and even some substantive properties. By dem-
onstrating this more extensive parallelism, we will have shown that the
equivalence of notations is more than a coincidence,

Prosodic Segmentation Rules

We begin by summarizing the grammar of time-span reduction developed
in chapters 6 and7. There are three subcomponents, First, the segmenta-
tion rules (section 7.1) produce an exhaustive hierarchical segmentation
of the musical surface into time-spans. The time-spans form what might
be called a layered hierarchy. At the most local levels are the time-spans
we have called subgroups, those determined by metrical structure alone
and by metrical structure interacting with grouping. Next, there are one
or more levels of uncadenced groups; and at the largest levels the time-
spans are all cadenced groups. These layers are fixed in order from small-
est level to largest and cannot mix; for example, there cannot be a level
