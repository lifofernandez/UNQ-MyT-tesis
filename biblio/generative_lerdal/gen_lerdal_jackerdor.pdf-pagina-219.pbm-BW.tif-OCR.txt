PRWFR 4 (No Crossing Branches) If an event e; is a direct elaboration
of an event e;, every event between e, and e; must be a direct elaboration
of either e;, e;, Or some event berween them.

All four rules should be at this point self-explanatory, with the possible
exception of PRWFR 4. It says that if e; and e; form a closed part of the
tree, by virtue of one branching directly off the other, then no event
between them may be a branch of an event outside the region. The
abstract tree in 9.3 illustrates this.

92.3

In this tree esis a direct elaboration of e,, so PRWFR 4 says that all events
between them must be direct elaborations of either them or events be-
tween them. Since e, is a direct elaboration of e,, and e is a direct
elaboration of e, these two events satisfy the condition. However, e, is a
direct elaboration of es, Which is not between e, and e;. Hence PRWER 4
is violated and the tree is not well formed.

It may be worth mentioning that these well-formedness rules can easily
be modified for a purely melodic idiom such as Gregorian chant. In such
a case, the definitions of prolongation would be stated in melodic rather
than primarily harmonic terms. In the simplest situation, two events of
the same pitch would count as a prolongation and two of different
pitches would count as a progression. Intermediate relations, such as that
between “primary” and “secondary” tones, might in addition be defined
as weak prolongations. Other than these changes, the theory of prolon-
gational trees could be carried over intact.

As in the other components of the musical grammar, the well-formed-
ness rules underdetermine the choice of a most stable analysis for a
piece— they simply state the general properties of all possible analyses.
We now develop the preference rules by which the most stable tree for a
piece is constructed.
