Psychological and Linguistic Connections

In chapter 1 we said that one of the criteria for adequacy of our theory of
music is its ability to shed light on more general psychological issues. In
this chapter we present some ways in which the formal theory developed
in chapters 3, 4, 7, and 9 reveals clear connections with existing theories
in psychology and linguistics, and we reflect on the possible conseguences
of these connections.

Neisser 1967 (pp. 245-248) points out an important similarity in
spirit berween generative linguistics and the Gestalt psychology of the
1920s to the 1940s. As we said in chapter 1, our theory is conceived with
the same general goals as generative linguistics: to give an account of one
aspect of (largely unconscious) human knowledge, explicating the char-
acter of a certain class of intuitions, and to divide this knowledge into
innate and learned parts. Thus our theory of music is another instance of
the sort of cognitive theory discussed by Neisser. One burden of this
chapter will be to use the theory of music to forge a more than merely
spiritual connection berween generative linguistics and Gestalt psychol-
ogy. Section 12.1 reviews the similarities presented in chapter 3 between
the rules of musical grouping and the processes involved in visual form
perception. This leads to some discussion of how some of the defects of
Gestalt theory can be overcome in the light of contemporary linguistics
and the present music theory. Finally, we survey recent work in vision
whose general form resembles our music theory.

One of the striking differences berween music theory and linguistic
theory, mentioned in chapter 1, is the presence in music theory of prefer-
ence rules, a rule type foreign to generative-transformational grammar.
Section 12.2 suggests some cases of current issues in linguistic theory
where the preference-rule formalism appears to provide insightful solu-
tions, suggesting that linguistics and music theory are not as different in

-this respect as might otherwise have been supposed.
Section 12.3 describes a strong parallel between certain aspects of
