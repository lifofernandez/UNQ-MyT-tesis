that the speaker dislikes X. Here, if rule 12.5 is obeyed, rule 12.4b 15
violated. This interpretation—ethat the speaker is lying— might be ap-
propriate f there were a third party in the conversation who was a friend
of X and did not know the speaker's relation to X and whom the speaker
did not wish to offend. Alternatively, the interpretation in which 12.4b is
obeyed and 12.5 is violated is ironic: the speaker is saying just the oppo-
site of what he means.

The rules presented in 12.4 and 12.5 do not deal with utterances that
are questions, such as 12.3. A rule must be introduced that addresses the
speaker's sincerity in requests, parallel to 12.4b for declaratives. A rea-
sonable first approximation is 12.6.

12.6
Prefer to assume the speaker needs what he requests.

In 12.3, if the question is taken literally, in accordance with rule 12.5, the
utterance is a request for information that the hearer can be fairly sure
the speaker does not need, in violation of 12.6. The interpretation that
does least violence to the literal reading of 12.3 but satisfies 12.6 is to
read it as a request for the salt.

The interaction of these rules is analogous to the interaction of musical
preference rules. A major difference in Grice”s theory, though, is that it
lacks a formal characterization of the set of structures out of which
possible intended meanings are chosen; such a characterization would
correspond to the well-formedness rules of music theory. In particular,
when literal interpretation is abandoned, a new interpretation is chosen
thatis close to the literal one according to a highly complex but unspeci-
fied metric of closeness. Nonetheless, the similarity of Grice's pragmatic
rules to preference rules for music points to a qualitative difference be-
tween pragmatics and the bulk of semantics, syntax, and phonology. The
example of musical grammar provides a precedent from another cogni-
tive domain for maintaining the distinction berween pragmatic rules and
other rule types in linguistic theory. Bach and Harnish (1979, chapter 8)
develop a treatment of Gricean principles not unlike what we have pro-
posed here.

Word Meanings

One of the fundamental problems foór a theory of word meaning is to
explicate the intuitions behind a judgment that a given individual (thing
or person) or a given category (class of things or persons) is or is not an
instance of the category named by a given word. Where the category is
named by a noun, these judgments take the form of assessing the truth of
sentences of the forms given in 12.7.

12.7

a. That [pointing] is a y.

b. X isay. [where X is a proper name or definite description]
c. An xisay. [where x is a common noun]
