chapters 6 and7, the time-span reduction at the quarter-note level (given
below the metrical structure) contains pitch repetitions that do produce
the desired metrical structure, Hence metrical preference with respect to
pitch repetition must be derived in this case from the time-span reduction
of the proper level.

Finally, the related phenomenon of harmonic rhythm produces strong
cues for metrical structure. Harmonic rhythm can be regarded as the
pattern of durations created by successive changes in harmony, not only
at the musical surface but at underlying reductional levels. The relevance
of harmonic rhythm to metrical structure can be incorporated into the
present theory by treating duration of a harmony as still another kind of
length in MPR $. As in the case of individual lines, the rule may invoke
the time-span reduction in order to abstract away from nonharmonic
tones and ornamental changes in harmony.

Having noted all these generalizations of the notion of length, we now
can state the final version of MPR 5.

MPR $ (Length), final version Prefer a metrical structure in which a

relatively strong beat occurs at the inception of either

. a relatively long pitch-event,

. a relatively long duration of a dynamic,

. a relatively long slur,

.a relatively long pattern of articulation,

. a relatively long duration of a pitch in the relevant levels of the time-
span reduction, or

. a relatively long duration of a harmony in the relevant levels of the
time-span reduction (harmonic rhythm),

As in the case of preference rules for grouping, not all cases of MPR $
are of the same intrinsic strength. For instance, example 4.33a presents a
conflict between a prolonged pitch-event and a slur of the same length.
The beat of the half-note level falls most naturally on the long note,
indicating that MPR Sa overrides MPR Sc in this situation. (If a performer
wants to project the strong beat on the E, he will typically accent it and
both shorten and remove stress from the quarter-note D, affecting the
application of preference rules.) Similarly, 4.33b places MPRs Sc and Se
in conflict. Here it is unclear which rule should dominate.

4.33

 

The strongest case of MPR $ seems to be case f (harmonic rhythm). For
example, the long note in 4.34a clearly attracts the strong beat; but given
the harmonic context in 4.34b, the strong beat falls most naturally on the
