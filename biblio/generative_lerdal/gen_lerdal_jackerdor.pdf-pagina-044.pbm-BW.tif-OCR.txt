grouping intuitions result; when they conflict, the listener has ambiguous
or vague intuitions.

Some simple experiments comparing musical grouping with a visual
analog suggest the general principles behind grouping preference rules.
Intuitions about the visual grouping of collections of small shapes were
explored in detail by psychologists of the Gestalt tradition such as Wert-
heimer (1923), KÃ³hler (1929), and Koffka (1935). In 3.6a the left and
middle circles group together and the right circle is perceived as separate;
that is, the field is most naturally seen as two circles to the left of one
circle. In 3.6b, on the other hand, the middle and right circles are seen as
grouped together and the left circle is separate.

The principle behind this grouping obviously involves relative distance:
the circles that are closer together tend to form a visual group. The
grouping effect can be enhanced by exaggerating the difference of dis-
tances, as in 3.7a; it can be weakened by reducing the disparity, as in
3.7b. If the middie circle is equidistant from the outer circles, as in 3.7c,
no particular grouping intuition emerges.

As Wertheimer 1923 observes, similar effects exist in the grouping of

musical events. Consider the rhythms in 3.8.

The perceptions about grouping for these five examples are auditory
analogs to the visual perceptions in 3.6 and 3.7. The first two notes of
3.8a group together (the example is heard as two notes followed by one
note); the last two notes group together in 3.8b; the grouping of the first
two is very strong in 3.8c and relatively weak in 3.8d; 3.8e has no
particular perceived grouping. These examples make it evident that on
a very elementary level the relative intervals of time between attack
points of musical events make an important contribution to grouping
perception.
