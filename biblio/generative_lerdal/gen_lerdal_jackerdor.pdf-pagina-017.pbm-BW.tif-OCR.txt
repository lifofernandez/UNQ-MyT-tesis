2.1
Grouping Structure

13

The process of grouping is common to many areas of human cognition. I£
confronted with a series of elements or a sequence of events, a person
spontaneously segments or “chunks” the elements or events into groups
of some kind. The ease or difficulty with which he performs this opera-
tion depends on how well the intrinsic organization of the input matches
his internal, unconscious principles for constructing groupings. For music
the input is the raw sequences of pitches, attack points, durations, dy-
namics, and timbres in a heard piece. When a listener has construed a
grouping structure for a piece, he has gone a long way toward “making
sense” of the piece: he knows what the units are, and which units belong
together and which do not. This knowledge in turn becomes an impor-
tant input for his constructing other, more complicated kinds of musical
structure. Thus grouping can be viewed as the most basic component of
musical understanding.

The most fundamental characteristic of musical groups is that they are
heard in a hierarchical fashion. A motive is heard as part of a theme, a
theme as part of a theme-group, and a section as part of a piece. To reflect
these perceived hierarchies we represent groups by slurs placed beneath
the musical notation. A slur enclosed within a slur signifies that a group is
heard as part of a larger group. For example, in 2.1 the groups marked p
are heard as part of the larger group marked q.

The concept hierarchy must be examined with some precision. A
hierarchical structure, in the sense used in this theory, is an organization
composed of discrete elements or regions related in such a way that one
element or region subsumes or contains other elements or regions. A
subsumed or contained element or region can be said to be subordinate
to the element or region that subsumes or contains it; the latter can be
said to dominate, or be superordinate to, the former. In principle this
process of subordination (or domination) can continue indefinitely. Thus
all elements or regions in a hierarchy except those at the very top and
bottom of the structure are subordinate in one direction and dominating
in the other. Elements or regions that are about equally subordinate
within the entire hierarchy can be thought of as being at a particular
hierarchical level. A particular level can be spoken of as small-scale or
large-scale, depending on the size of its constituent elements or regions.

In a strictly hierarchical organization, a dominating region contains
subordinate regions but cannot partially overlap with those regions.
Hence the grouping structure in 2.2a represents a possible organization,
but the grouping structure in 2.2b represents an impossible organization:
at ¿ two regions overlap at both levels 1 and 2, at j two regions overlap
