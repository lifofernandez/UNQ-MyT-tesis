Remarks on the
Basis of Tonal
Systems

 

In the chapters on reductions we have simply assumed the conventional
notions of harmony and counterpoint for classical Western tonal music,
without attempting to provide the principled basis for these notions that
a complete theory of musical cognition would require. This section
sketches some essential features of a foundation for the system of pitch
relationships in tonal music and tonal idioms in general.

Historically, the most prevalent approach to explaining the basis of
tonality has been an appeal to the natural overtone series. The argument
goes back at least to Rameau; two recent advocates have been Hindemith
(1952) and Bernstein (1976). Although we agree that tonality reflects an
innate organization of the pitch structure of music, we will review why
the overtone series has only a limited influence on this ability.

One part of the argument involves simultaneously sounded tones. We
observe that, next to singing in unison with each other, people find 1t
easiest to sing in octaves, often doing so without conscious effort, People
sometimes even sing in fifths, thinking that they are singing in unison, but
this phenomenon is less prevalent than that at the octave. These results
are not confined to humans: apparently, ¡f dogs are trained to respond to
a particular pitch, and their responses are then tested on different pitches,
a pitch an octave away from the original elicits much greater response
than surrounding tones.

To account for these results, it has been observed that the octave and
the fifth are intervals formed by the first two overtones of the natural
harmonic series, as shown in figure 11.1.

The theory is that we can consider two pitches similar, or that we find
their combination less dissonant, more pleasing, or easier to sing, if one
of them forms a unison with an overtone of the other or if they are
overtones of a common fundamental. Thus, goes the argument, the inter-
vallic inventory of music has grown gradually more complex or sophisti-
cated as people have come to make use of more overtones,5

This hypothesis appears to account for certain developments in the
history of Western music, since the next harmonic interval to appear after
the fifth, during the Middle Ages, was the fourth—the interval between
the second and third overtones. After that, the major third began to
appear—the interval between the third and fourth overtones. By sound-
ing simultaneously the overtones up through the fourth, we arrive at the
major triad, the fundamental building block of Western tonal music, By
building a major triad on the second overtone as well as on the funda-
