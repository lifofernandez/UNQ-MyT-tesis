The second ambiguity in the grouping has to do with how a 3-part
form (ABA'”) groups at the next larger level. There are three possibilities:
ABA'=AB+A"=the piece, ABA'=A+BA"=the piece, or ABA'=the piece
(no two-part division). The last possibility is the least interesting because
it gives the least structure, so we will disregard it. That leaves AB+A' or
A+BA'. The problem again concerns which segments are to be construed
as parallel. In 10.12, are measure 1 and measure 12 parallel beginnings
(in which case the form is AB+A/), or are measures 6—7 and measures
16-19 parallel endings (in which case the form is A+BA')? (As discussed
in note 2 to chapter 9, the same issue arises with sonata form, historically
as well as analytically.) Here we have chosen AB+A”, largely because the
B section (measures 8-11) strongly prolongs the V in measures 5—7
(GPR 7). But the real point is the ambiguity itself. The rhyme scheme
(aab/ccb) and the rhythmic patterns in the voice support the parallelism
berween measures 6-7 and 16-19 (A+BA”), whereas the narrative
structure of the first verse?—the forthright action of the first poetic line,
three anxious questions in the second to fifth lines, followed by the ap-
parent resolution of the sixth line— favors the grouping together of mea-
sures 511 and the parallelism of measure 1 and measure 12 (AB+A”).
Schubert has it both ways.5

A consequence of the AB+A' grouping is that the final cadence (mea-
sures 11-12) does not function in the time-span reduction (10.12) at any
grouping level smaller than the piece itself. This seems intuitively correct,
since when the I arrives in measure 12 it seems like the beginning of the
reprise (A”), not the structural ending. This peculiar musical situation
originates in the dramatic situation, which is best discussed after an
examination of the prolongational reduction.

Included with the prolongational tree in 10.13 are the hypermetrical
structure and the AB+A' grouping levels. Bar lines are added at measure
S and measure 12 to emphasize that these are the points of structural
arrival (V and I, respectively); motivic detail (as well as the rhyme
scheme) supports the association of these two moments. The tree brings
out these connections by describing measures 5—11 as a V prolongation
and measures 12-19 as a corresponding I prolongation. Thus, from the
vantage of prolongational analysis, the final cadence actually begins at
measure 5. For this assignment to be made, closeness of pitch connection
(PRPR 3) (the strong right prolongation of the V in measures 5—11) must
override time-span importance (PRPR 1), since the V in measure 11 is one
level more important than the V in measure 6 in the time-span reduction.

The difficulty with this analysis is that the V in measures 5—6 feels like
a half cadence, not part of the final cadence. For the rules to predict this
intuition, the alternative grouping A+BA' must be adopted to create a
time-span reduction in which the Vs in measures 6 and 11 separate at the
next smaller level. Then, with added support from PRPR 2 (congruence),
PRPR 1 can override PRPR 3. The result appears in 10.14 (sketched at a
