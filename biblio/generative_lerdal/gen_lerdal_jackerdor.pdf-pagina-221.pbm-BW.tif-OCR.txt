But there are cases where even this is not so—for example, the slow
movement of Bach's Fourth Brandenburg Concerto or Schumann's song
“Im wunderschónen Monat Mai” from Dichterliebe—where the piece
ends on a nontonic chord that leads into the next movement or song. In
these exceptional cases, the point of maximal relaxation occurs before
the end, and the very end is a departure from the head.

Having chosen a prolongational head, we have created one or possibly
two regions in Which a maximally important event must be determined:
from the beginning to the head, and (if the head is not at the very end)
from the head to the end. In continuing the construction of the tree, wWe
must solve three problems: defining regions of rule application in the
general case, finding the prolongationally most important event in a re-
gion of rule application, and deciding whether this event is to be at-
tached as a right branch to a preceding event or as a left branch to a
following event. All of these problems were treated informally in chapter
8; we take them up in more detail in the next subsection and the follow-
ing two sections.

Defining Regions of Rule Application

To find the regions in terms of which prolongational stability is deter-
mined, let us examine the abstract trees in 9.4. In these examples, e , e»,
and so on stand for events in underlying grouping structure. They are
numbered to reflect order of elaboration rather than temporal sequence.
The symbol * stands for the boundary of the piece; for notational con-
venience we think of each piece as preceded and followed by the abstract
symbol %. Also, for the moment, the manner of attachment (strong or
weak prolongation or progression) can be disregarded. Finally, in the
following discussion we use the notation (e;—e;) to stand for the string of
events between, but not including, e; and e;.

Suppose that e, in 9.4a is the prolongational head, and that e, has been
chosen, by whatever means, as the most important event in the region
(H-—e ). Because there is no other place to attach it, e, must be a direct
elaboration of e¡. The piece is now divided into three regions in which
prolongational importance must be determined: (%-e»), (e:—e ), and
(e1—%), as indicated by the curly brackets beneath 9.4a.

Next, suppose that, by whatever means, a prolongationally most im-
portant event e; is chosen in the region (*-—e>). As shown by the dotted
lines in 9.4b, the geometry of the tree permits e; to be attached either to
eg or to e¡. However, what happens if e; s attached to e ? Since branches
may not cross, e3 must be attached higher than es, which indicates that it
is prolongationally more important. But this contradicts the assumption
that e, was originally chosen as the most important event in (4%-—e ). Thus
e; can only be attached to e»; the other attachment violates the musical
meaning of the tree structure.
