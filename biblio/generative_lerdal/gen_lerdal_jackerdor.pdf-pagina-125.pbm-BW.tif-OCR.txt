Motivation for Prolongational Reduction

It would be disappointing to stop at time-span reduction. Too many
aspects of musical intuition, of exactly the kind one would want from a
reduction, are not expressed by it. For instance, it is common for a group
or phrase to begin with an event identical or almost identical to the event
that ended the previous group or phrase; this is a major means for estab-
lishing continuity across group boundaries. Characteristic examples are
the beginning of Beethoven's Sonata op. 2, no. 3 (example 5.13a), in
which the V carries across a group boundary, and the beginning of
Mozart's G Minor Symphony (reduced to a harmonic and linear skeleton
in 5,13b), in which the ii? carries across a group boundary.

5.13

 

 

Now it is obvious that the first group in 5.13a progresses from Ito V, and
the second from V to l; likewise, the first group in 5.13b progresses
from i to ii3, and the second from ii? through V* to i. These elementary
perceptions are expressed in time-span reduction, since its function is to
relate pitch structure at every level to the segmentation produced by
meter and grouping. But it is equally obvious that the harmonic rhythm
in both cases prolongs across group boundaries.?9 Time-span reduction
fails to express this sense of continuity.

For a related problem, return to the Mozart K, 331 phrase, There is a
sense in which the opening tonic is prolonged, through lower-neighbor
motion in measures 2—3, into measure 4, at which point the first real
structural movement takes place, in three ways at once: contrapuntally,
by the first independent motion of the outer voices (which until then are
in parallel tenths); harmonically, through the ““cadential preparation”
(the ¡i5 chord) to the cadential V; and melodically, by the underlying
motion from the third to the second scale degree. The overall effect of the
phrase is very much due to these three dimensions working in concert, as
indicated in 5.14,
