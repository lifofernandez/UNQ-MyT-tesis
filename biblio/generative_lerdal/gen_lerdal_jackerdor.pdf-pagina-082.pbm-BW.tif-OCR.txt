quirements of parallelism must have strong beats at the eighth-note level
spaced two beats apart; the two possibilities are given as structures ¿ and
di. Structure ¿ contains only one violation of MPR 3 per four beats;
structure ¿ contains two. Therefore MPR 3 predicts, in conformance with
intuition, that structure ¿ should be the more stable of the two.

Because the regularity of 4.16b involves a span of four eighths, there is
an additional metrical level to account for. Example 4.17a gives the two
possible half-note levels for structure ¿ of 4.16b; example 4.17b gives
them for structure úi.

In 4.17a every beat at the quarter-note level coincides with an attack,
Hence either choice for the half-note level results in alternate violations
of MPR 3 (marked by asterisks at the half-note level), and structures ¿ and
ii are predicted to be commensurate in naturalness, In 4.17b, on the other
hand, beats of the quarter-note level fall alternately on attacks and rests,
Hence structure ¿, with half-note beats falling on attacks, produces no
new violations of MPR 3; but structure z/, with half-note beats falling on
rests, does produce further violations. The result is that structure ¿ is
predicted to be more natural than structure úí,

Having demonstrated the behavior of MPR 3 with respect to a number
of rhythmic configurations, we now consider another source of metrical
differentiation with similar properties: local stress (accent). By local
stress we mean extra intensity on the attack of a pitch-event. We include
as kinds of stress not only those marked by the signs > and A, but also
those indicated by sf, rf, fp, and subito f. In a regular sequence of at-
tacked notes, those with stress will preferably be heard as strong beats, In
4.18, for instance, one most naturally hears structure 7; structure %í is
heard as syncopation or cross-accent,
