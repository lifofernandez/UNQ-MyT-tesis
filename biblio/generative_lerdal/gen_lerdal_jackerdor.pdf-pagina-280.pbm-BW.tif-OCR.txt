harmonic instability. A double tree analysis would in addition show the
melodic resolution, thus giving a fuller characterization of the deceptive
cadence.

Before we draw any theoretical conclusions from these examples, let us
examine another familiar passage. Suppose one “prefers” Schenker's re-
duction of the first phrase of K. 331 (Schenker 1925, 1935) to the ones
offered in section 9.5 (see also the remarks in section 7.3 concerning the
melodic primacy of Ct or E in measure 1). Schenker's is certainly a
plausible reading; in our secondary notation it looks like 10.21.6

10.21

 

 

How could our theory generate 10.21? One might grant the promi-
nence of the E due to its relative height (TSRPR 3), or, alternatively, fuse
measure 1 (and measure 2) (TSRWFR 3b). But there are more serious
difficulties: the bass (that is, the harmony) and the melody must receive
contrasting structural descriptions. In measures 1—2, in the bass the first
events dominate the second (A over Ctt, G over B), but in the melody the
second events dominate the first (E over Ctt, D over B). In measure 4 two
events in the melody (C£ and B) over the V must be structurally impor-
tant, but the C is not harmonically well supported (a cadential $). (This
particular situation is common in Schenkerian reduction, and has caused
dissent; in its defense, it is not the melodic note in these cases that forms
the dissonant fourth with the bass.) In short, to arrive at Schenker's
analysis, one must assign related but different trees to the melodic and
harmonic structures, as in 10.22.

Preliminary investigation has indicated that in some passages the dis-
crepancy between harmonic and melodic trees can be much greater than
in 10.20b and 10.22. On the other hand, we feel that Schenker sometimes
ascribes too great an independence to the outer voices (for example, in
the first phrase of the Bach chorale “Ich bin's, ich sollte búissen” in
Schenker 1932). The problem is to find the right balance—ro let the bass,
which governs the harmony, control the connective possibilities in the
melodic tree, yet allow a certain leeway for melodic notes to form their
own connections. At this point we are unclear whether such double
analyses should derive as a second stage of prolongational reduction
from the single prolongational trees so far developed in the theory, or
