Words, for example, may contain feet but may not be contained in them.
Thus phonological segmentation is a hierarchy that is “layered” in the
same sense as time-span segmentation.

As in the case of the time-span categories subgroup and group, each of
the phonological categories has a different principle of segmentation. The
principle for segmentation into syllables is approximately as follows:
Each language has a characteristic class of syllable onsets. For example,
in English, syllables (hence words) can begin either with no consonant,
with any single consonant, or with a variety of clusters such as st, tr, spl,
etc. but not including zd, pk, etc. The basic principle in forming the
syllabic segmentation is to set syllable boundaries so as to maximize the
length of syllable onsets, in conformance with the principles of basic
syllable composition of the language. So, for example, in Pakistan, a
syllable boundary is placed before st, since it is an allowable syllable
onset. However, in Tuesday, the medial cluster sd (phonetically 2d) is not
a possible syllable onset of English, so the boundary is set between the
two consonants.$ Syllable boundaries are of course set berween words as
well.

The principles for segmentation into feet vary among languages. Sel-
kirk argues that French essentially has primarily monosyllabic feet.
Vergnaud and Halle (1979), examining the literature on a wide variety of
languages, find three other sorts of foot-formation rules: those establish-
ing bisyllabic feet, those establishing trisyllabic feet, and those establish-
ing feet of unlimited length (bounded by word boundaries or syllables of
a specified type). English appears to have monosyllabic, bisyllabic, and
trisyllabic feet, depending on the content of the syllables gathered up into
a foot. The relevant factors are the tenseness of the syllable's vowel and
the nature of the consonants, if any, at the end of the syllable. So far as is
known, syllable types are not distinguished for prosodic purposes in any
language by the nature of their initial consonant(s).

Some examples are given in 12.13. Example 12.13a is a monosyllabic
foot; 12.13b is a bisyllabic foot; 12.13c is a trisyllabic foot, which, like
all trisyllabic feet in English, begins with a bisyllabic foot; 12.13d, by
contrast with 12.13b,is a bisyllabic word consisting of two monosyllabic
feet—the difference between this and 12.13b accounts for the fact that
its second syllable bears secondary stress and that of 12.13b does not.
