complex then repeats itself. In 8.23e the ii is in parentheses because it
does not appear in Op. 109. This weakens the sense of closure. It also
creates a balance among pairs of events: as the partial branchings in 8.24
show, the first two pairs of events form right branchings, the second two
pairs left branchings. This symmetry cuts across the larger-level asym-
metry of tonic prolongation (six events) plus cadence (two events).

Local versus Global Hearing

A significant aspect of prolongational branching emerges if one of these
phrasal analyses is considered within a more global context. To illustrate,
let us suppose that 8.23b is the consequent phrase of an interrupted and
completed antecedent-consequent period (8.25).

 

If the two phrases are analyzed separately (8.25a), the antecedent shows
an overall tensing to the half-cadential V and the consequent repeats the
self-contained structure of 8.23b. In the context of the entire period,
however, the consequent must be analyzed differently: the opening I of
the consequent is heard as a prolongational repetition of the initial I of
the antecedent, and the cadence of the consequent is heard as resolving
the period as a whole (8.25b). When the intervening events in the conse-
quent are assigned branches, as in 8.25c, their subordination remains the
