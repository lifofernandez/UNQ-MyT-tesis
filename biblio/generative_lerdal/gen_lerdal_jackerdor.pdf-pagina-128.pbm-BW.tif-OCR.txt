Time-Span Reduction: The Analytic System

In this chapter we discuss time-span segmentation and time-span tree
structure in some detail and conclude with a complete time-span reduc-
tion. The rules that assign analyses within this component are developed
in chapter 7.

Recall from section 5.4 that in time-span reduction the hierarchy of
time-spans derives from the metrical and grouping components, and that
a single structurally most important event is chosen as head for each
time-span. Time-spans can thus be thought of as apprehended rhythmic
units in terms of which pitch structure is heard. We will first explore the
organization of these units,

We begin with relatively global levels. Consider the finale theme of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. We may say, unexceptionally, that it seg-
ments into six 4-bar phrases, which group together on the basis of paral-
lelism (A A'BA' BA') into the structure shown in example 6.1.
