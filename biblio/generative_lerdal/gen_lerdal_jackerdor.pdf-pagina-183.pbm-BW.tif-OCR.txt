Prolongational Reduction: The Analytic System

As with time-span reduction, we divide the exposition of prolongational
reduction into two parts. In this chapter we develop the meaning of and
notation for prolongational trees, and gradually work our way toward a
complete prolongational analysis; in chapter 9 we will develop the sys-
tem of rules that assigns prolongational analyses.!

In the grouping, metrical, and time-span components there is nothing
that expresses the sense of tension and relaxation involved in the ongoing
progress of music. To be sure, we have described local tensions arising
from conflict of preference rules —for example, the rhythmic tension of
syncopation. But the opposite of such tension is the absence of tension.
The kind of tension we wish to address here is the more elastic sort whose
opposite is relaxation—the incessant breathing in and out of music in
response to the juxtaposition of pitch and rhythmic factors. We wish to
be able to speak of points of relative tension and repose and the way
music progresses from one to the other. This is the function of prolonga-
tional reduction. By viewing prolongational reduction in this way, we are
dealing not only with pitch reduction but with an essential aspect of
musical rhythm, for tension and relaxation are rhythmic properties.?
We conceive of tension and relaxation as relative terms defined with
respect to particular events. For example, an arrival at an event such as
the end of a phrase normally constitutes a point of relative relaxation;
departure from this event normally constitutes the beginning of an in-
crease in tension as the music progresses toward the next goal. An event
such as the dominant of a full cadence gives the sense of being a step in an
ongoing process of relaxation. Other events, such as the climax of a
phrase, may give the sense of being at a stage of maximal tension.
We would like to express such intuitions in an articulate and systematic
