Hierarchical relations among these connected or unconnected events
are conveyed much the same as in grouping analysis: slurs “contain”
other slurs. For instance, in 8.30e the slur connecting y to z 1s contained
by the slur connection x to z. Even if (as in 8.30f) there is no containing
slur, there is bound to be a larger level of analysis that clarifies the
situation. Thus in 8.30g y connects to ", turning the connection between
y and z into a contained slur and the connection between x and y into an
“appended” slur. In 8.30h the strong prolongation contains the connec-
tions between x and y and between y and z, and it is deducible that the
connection berween y and z dominates that between x and y because z is
also part of the larger slur. In doubtful cases, one can always refer to the
tree.

Because the drawing of slurs among all the voices in a passage would
be visually confusing, we will usually include only the bass and soprano
lines in the secondary notation. It is also convenient to omit inconsequen-
tial (small-level) details. As a clarification, large-level events such as
structural beginnings and cadences can be indicated by “white” note
heads. Finally, the prolongational tree itself can apply to abstractions like
those in 8.30, to the secondary notation, or, where practicable, to the
actual notated music. In the last case the secondary notation is placed
beneath the actual music. All of these provisions are variously illustrated
in 8.31a, the prolongational reduction of the first phrase of “O Haupt,”
and in 8.31b, a repeat of the antecedent-consequent period in 8.25c
repeated in the secondary notation.
