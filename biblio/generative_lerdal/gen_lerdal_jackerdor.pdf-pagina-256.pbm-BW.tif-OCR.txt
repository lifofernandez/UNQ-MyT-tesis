21—22 to the ensuing two bars instead of the previous two bars. The
grouping structure of the B section thereby becomes identical to that of
the A section (2+2+2+2+2=2+414=2+8=10), and likewise (GPR 6)
for the reprise. In this light, the right hand in measures 29-—30 fills in the
space, so to speak, that was left vacant in measures 1—2.

In the metrical analysis in 10.1 and 10.2 we note some conflict con-
cerning the placement of the largest level of beats: Should they occur on
the downbeats of measures 1,5,9,... or on the downbeats of measures
3,7,11,... ? Following Schachter 1980, we have chosen the second alter-
native, even though it results in a cadential $ in a relatively weak metrical
position (measure 5, etc.); mitigating factors are the more in-phase pat-
tern (MPR 2) and the continuance of regularity (MPR 10) into the B
section, where the strongest beats obviously take place on the downbeats
of measures 19, 23, and 27. This regularity then persists—though again
ambiguously —to the end of the piece.

Under this interpretation, then, the metrical periodicity proceeds uni-
formly throughout, despite irregularities in grouping structure. A subtle
consequence of this analysis is that the motive rising to measure 17
receives a different metrical interpretation in measure 23. More broadly,
the large-scale metrical structure of the B section reverses that of the A
section: the strongest beat is on the downbeat ofiits first bar instead of its
third, and so on. (The A' section, because it lacks the two introductory
bars and hence begins next to a strong beat, prepares the way for this
change.) Finally, because the B section is 10 bars long, the grouping-
meter relationship in the A” section automatically reverts to what it was
at the beginning. Thus the larger grouping-meter parallelism is satisfied in
the end, despite intervening divergences.

It might be argued that in certain tonal pieces grouping and meter can
become completely independent of one another, each going its own way,
forming its own articulative structure, and occasionally converging with
the other at a structural downbeat.! Although such structures are expres-
sible within our analytic system, we have found no example more com-
plex in this regard than this Schubert waltz. In a sense, it can happen here
because the piece is a dance—there are enough conventional regularities
to permit the perception of significant divergences in patterning between
