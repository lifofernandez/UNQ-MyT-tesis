essential not to confuse their respective properties. This admonition is all
the more important because much recent theoretical writing has confused
their properties in one way or another. Two points in particular need to
be emphasized: groups do not receive metrical accent, and beats do not
possess any inherent grouping. Let us amplify these points in turn.
That groups do not receive metrical accent will be conveyed if we
compare two rhythmic analyses of the opening of the minuet of Haydn's
Symphony no. 104, the first (2.12) utilizing the notations proposed above
and the second (2.13) taken from Cooper and Meyer 1960 (p. 140).

Beneath the music in 2.12 appear the grouping and metrical structures
heard by the listener. Considered independently, each structure is intui-
tively straightforward and needs no further justification in the present
context. What must be stressed 1s that, even though the two structures
obviously interact, neither is intrinsically implicated in the other; thatis,
they are formally (and visually) separate. By contrast, Cooper and Meyer
(1960) are concerned from the start with patterns of accentuation within
and across groups. Though this concern is laudable, it leads them to
assign accent to groups as such. And, since groups have duration, the
apparent result is that beats are given duration. In 2.13 these difficulties
do not emerge immediately at level 1, which—notational differences
aside—corresponds closely (until measure 7) to the smaller levels of
grouping and metrical analysis in 2.12. But at level 2 in 2.13, each group
of level 1 is marked strong or weak in its entirety. If metrical accent is
intended (as it evidently was at level 1), this result is plainly wrong, since
the second and third beats of each bar must all be equally weak regardless
of metrical distinctions on the first beats. What is meant, we believe, is
