Though we have made heavy use of motivic relationships in motivating
and stating the preference rules of the theory, we have not addressed the
important issue of how to formalize these relationships. Indeed, it may
seem odd, given our linguistically oriented methodology, that we have
not proposed a component of thematic and motivic “transformations” —
after all, transformations are so central to linguistic theory (though see
note 10 to chapter 1).

To explain why we have avoided this approach, we must first point out
that the word transformation does not normally mean the same thing in
music as it does in linguistics. Its linguistic usage is adapted from
mathematics and denotes the conversion of one syntactic construction
into another, semantically related construction. Our usage has been
similar, in that a transformational rule in our theory converts one musical
structure into another structure that retains the “sense” of the former. In
both cases, the number of transformations is finite. In musical parlance,
however, transformation is used in a more general sense: it signifies any
thematic, motivic, or other change in musical material such that the result
of the transformation is recognized as a modification of the previous state
of the material.

This more generalized usage poses difficulties f it is to be treated in a
systematic fashion. Let us put the problem in the following way: Given
any two sets of pitches and durations, it is possible logically to “trans-
form” one into the other, and to do so in any number of ways. Every
musician has been confronted with analyses that relate musical materials
indiscriminately. As recognized by Meyer (1973), the problem is to con-
strain the admissible relations, to limit the permissible transformations.
Presumably a theory that purports to describe the musical intuitions of
the experienced listener should be able to treat this matter. It may in fact
be possible to construct a system in which only certain musical ideas can
be related only if certain transformations (in the general sense) take
place; such a system would establish the relative proximity or distance of
musical ideas. There are two reasons why we have skirted this area in
favor of the four domains of analysis developed here, both alluded to in
section 1.4.

First, themes, motives, and other musical ideas (in the limited sense in
which they are usually meant) are relatively local patterns that are sub-
sumed under more generalized perceptions of rhythmic structure and
pitch elaboration; that is, they are heard within the context of a metrical
organization, a set of grouping boundaries, and the two hierarchies of
pitch importance. If these ideas were developed compositionally without
respect to context, the result would be largely chaotic; in the work of
sophisticated composers, they often seem inextricably bound up with
context. It would be pointless to discuss them without a theory of the
structures in which they are embedded.*
