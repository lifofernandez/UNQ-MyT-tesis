second eighth of each group, where the harmony changes, and the quarter
note is heard as syncopated. Hence MPR Sf has overridden MPR 5a here.

We will not work out all the combinations of relative strengths of rules
here. Nor will we attempt to quantify rule strengths, for reasons dis-
cussed in section 3.3. The reader should, however, be aware that relative
intrinsic strength of preference rules plays an important role in deter-
mining the most stable analysis.

A Linguistic Parallel
It should not be without interest that the last two metrical preference
rules discussed (those for stress and length) are reminiscent of the princi-
ples governing prosodic features in language. It is well known (see for
example Trubetzkoy 1939, chapter IV.5) that there are a limited number
of discrete ways in which languages mark the distinction berween strong
and weak syllables. Some languages use stress (differentiation in inten-
sity), others length, and others higher pitch as a mark of strength. Among
other things, the opposition berween strong and weak often plays an im-
portant role in the metrical structure of poetry, where linguistic material
is fitted to an abstract metrical pattern (see Halle and Keyser 1971).
That stress and length function as markers of metrical strength in
music as well as in language can hardly be a coincidence. Rather it seems
that we are dealing with a more general cognitive organization that has
manifestations in both musical and linguistic structure. This lends the
theory of metrical preference rules a significance beyond its usefulness for
musical purposes. (In section 12.3 we discuss a related parallel of music
and language in considerable detail.)

An Example

In section 2.2 we discussed some questions about the larger-level metrical
structure of the opening of Mozart's G Minor Symphony. We now apply
the metrical preference rules developed so far to derive the smaller levels
of metrical structureâ€”rhose levels not open to question. Again the ex-
ample is given without bars and beams; beats at the eighth-note level are
numbered for convenience. We treat the theme and bass line alone; we
have omitted the beginning of the first measure and the viola accom-
paniment as an exercise, in order to bring more rules into play.
