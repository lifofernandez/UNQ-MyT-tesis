8.27b; this is shown in 8.27c. The resultant minimal branching for
normative prolongational structure appears in 8.27d. Any phrase or sec-
tion that meets this condition possesses a degree of completeness; any
that does not sounds unbalanced or unfulfilled in terms of tension and
relaxation.

If, in addition, the prolongationally most important events in a given
region attach directly as a strong or weak prolongation, the resultant tree
combines normative structure with the basic form (8.28a). In other
words, this tree shows the basic form elaborated so as to fulfill normative
structure. Such a configuration feels more complete than either the basic
form or normative structure alone, and typically appears at various levels
of tonal structure from the phrase up to the entire piece.

A prevalent formal feature of the high Classical period (as opposed,
say, to the Baroque binary form) is the reprise of opening material in the
tonic. This causes an extra normative branch to be added to 8.28a, a
prolongational repetition that connects to the opening above the depar-
ture from the opening (8.28b). In the antecedent-conseguent period, this
extra branch stands for the beginning of the conseguent; in ABA' ternary
form, for the beginning of A'; in rounded binary form, for the beginning
of the reprise; in sonata form, for the beginning of the recapitulation.
(Note, incidentally, the similarity of 8.28b to the characteristic intra-
phrasal branchings in 8.23, in which the tonic is in one way or another
prolonged up to the cadential nucleus. This correspondence illuminates
the frequently heard remark that the high Classical forms were based on
the nature of the phrase.)

A partial prolongational analysis of the beginning of “La ci darem la
mano” from Mozart's Don Giovanni will illustrate these various struc-
tures. The tree for the antecedent phrase alone is given in 8.29. Note that
the branchings separate according to diatonic collection: the ii tenses off
the 1, and the V$V—V and then the VIV all lead as a tonicizing motion to
the cadential V. This tree thus displays a tensing-relaxing pattern, but
falls just short of normative structure because the uppermost left branch
attaches as a weak prolongation, not a progression; the cadence lacks a
subdominant preparation. Since the phrase moves from I to V, there is no
basic form.
