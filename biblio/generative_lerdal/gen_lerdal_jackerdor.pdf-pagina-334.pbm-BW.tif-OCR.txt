tween syntactic and musical trees, discussed in section 5.3, are too great
for such a grammatical comparison to be meaningful.

Why should there be such a parallelism? Given that both theories are
attempts to account for human cognitive abilities, the existence of paral-
lelism between them implies a claim that these areas are a respect in
which human musical and linguistic capacities overlap. In other words,
both capacities make use of some of the same organizing principles to
impose structure on their respective inputs, no matter how disparate
these inputs are 1n other respects.

However, i¡f this claim is true, it would be surprising if music and
language were the only human abilities so structured. Rather, we should
be led to look for something closely analogous to time-span structure in
many human abilities under the rubric of “temporal patterning,” from
event perception to motor control to the planning of extended strategies
of behavior. In particular, we should expect a hierarchically articulated
notion of headlelaboration to figure prominently in psychological theo-
ries of temporal organization.

One bit of suggestive evidence for this hypothesis is Lasher's (1978)
finding that sequences of ballet steps are invariably interpreted as a se-
quence of major movements, each preceded by preparatory movements.
Such a descriprion is easily seen to be a variant of time-span reduction
principles, with the major movements serving as heads of larger segments
and the preparatory movements as their elaborations. Notice how this
description is more highly structured than one articulated only in terms
of “chunking,” since it accords one element of each “chunk” the privi-
leged status of head.

Whether or not other kinds of organization eventually prove amenable
to more rigorous treatment along these lines, our main point should be
clear: The similarity between prosodic and musical structure can be used
as a point of triangulation for approaching an account of other tempo-
rally structured cognitive capacities.!*

Some readers may ask how the parallel between music and phonology
comports with evidence of brain localization. It is well known that the
left hemisphere of the brain (in right-handed people) subserves special-
ized linguistic functions, and that the right hemisphere is implicated in
musical perception. Bever and Chiarello (1974) report that in musically
naive listeners the right hemisphere seems to be dominant for certain
tasks of melodic perception, whereas in musically experienced listeners
the left hemisphere is dominant. They argue therefore that “being mu-
sically sophisticated has real neurological concomitants, permitting the
utilization of a different strategy of musical apprehension that calls on
left hemisphere function,” namely a more analytic and less holistic or
Gestalt form of processing.
