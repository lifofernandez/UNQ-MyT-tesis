The Complete Phrase

Combining the remarks on cadential preparation with the basic form, we
arrive at the structure in 8.21a: a structural beginning plus a nucleus of
left branchings at the cadence.

Now suppose that event 7 is the most important event in the phrase
between the opening tonic and the “cadential nucleus.” There are four
geometrically possible ways to connect , labeled , 7, j, and k in 8.21b. I£
branching 2 is chosen, 7 becomes an extended part of the “cadential
nucleus” and thus does not carry the phrase functionally beyond 8.21a. I£
branching j is selected, 7 connects to the cadential V without being part
of the ongoing, step-by-step process involved in cadencing. Though con-
ceivable, this possibility is difficult to imagine in practice. Branching ¿ is
unacceptable because it violates the supremacy of the cadence as the goal
