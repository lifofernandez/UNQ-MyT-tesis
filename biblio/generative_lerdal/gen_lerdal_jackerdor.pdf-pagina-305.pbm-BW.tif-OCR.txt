Suppose someone were to deny this distinction and to claim that any
arbitrary method of composition can create organizations that may be-
come cognitively salient to a listener with sufficient exposure. To be sure,
one's ability to structure input improves with exposure; this is implicit in
our idealization to the experienced listener. But the assertion that expo-
sure alone suffices for learning is tantamount to blind faith in the most
radical form of behaviorism: it attributes to the learner little ¡£ any innate
organization (disposition to learn certain types of organization rather
than others) beyond the ability to respond to reinforcement. There is an
overwhelming amount of evidence throughout all areas of psychology
that human ability to structure the environment is genetically highly
predetermined. We see no reason why musical capacity should be any
exception.

It is important not to misunderstand the relevance of this discussion to
aesthetic issues. Some critics of serialism, such as Hindemith (1952) and
Bernstein (1976), have seized on its perceptually more dubious aspects as
arguments against its validity as a compositional method. One could
make analogous objections to aleatoric and probabilistic techniques. But
such arguments miss the point. No one has offered a concrete theory of
how cognitive capacity bears on issues of aesthetic value. All that the
argument above implies is that listeners will find it difficult to assign any
rich structure to music composed by these techniques. This conclusion is
plausible, andit may account in part for the relative inaccessibility of this
music. But accessibility per se is not a measure of value. Some of the
world's greatest art is highly inaccessible; most of the most ephemeral art
is readily accessible. Both tonality and contemporary techniques have
produced acknowledged masterpieces; both have produced trash.

In short, our theory says nothing about the relative value of composi-
tional techniques. Nor do we advocate our theory as a novel composi-
tional method. In any case, it could not be applied directly as a generator
of pieces, because of the presence of preference rules. Obviously, what-
ever helps a composer compose his music is of value to him. We believe,
nonetheless, that our theory is relevant to compositional problems, in
that it focuses detailed attention on the facts of hearing. To the extent
that a composer cares about his listeners, this is a vital issue.
