Notice that the rule specifies branching into two words, rather than just
branching as in the previous rule. The reason for this is that the rule is not
sensitive to the number of syllables or feet in the constituent words. For
example, in both /abor day and labor union, main stress falls on labor,
even though in the latter case union branches into two syllables. (None-
theless, one can imagine generalizing prominence rules 2 and 3 into a
single rule if proper attention is paid to stating limitations on the ability
of rules to cross layers in the hierarchy.)

Finally, the aggregation of words into phonological phrases 1s gov-
erned by this rule from Liberman and Prince 1977:2?

Prominence Rule 4 (Nuclear Stress) In a phonological phrase that im-
mediately contains two phonological phrases or words, the second is
strong.

This rule accounts for the stress patterns of phrases like three red hats
and Jobn ate Bill's peach (represented only from word level up in 12.20).

At the level of phonological phrase there is also a prominence rule that
bears a more patent resemblance to rules of musical structure than the
four preceding rules. This is Liberman and Prince's rule of Iambic Rever-
sal, also commonly called the Rhythm Rule. Its effect is to shift stress
leftward in certain situations. For example, the words thirteen and Ten-
nessee have strongest stress on the last syllable when spoken in isolation;
