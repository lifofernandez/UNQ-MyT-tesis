Returning to the refinement of TSRPR 7, we can now stipulate that a
progression counts as a cadence only ¡f it functions as structural ending
for a group. More precisely, there must be a cadenced group G that has a
reductional level consisting of one other event (the b) followed by the
progression in question. If such a level does not exist in the reduction, an
apparent cadential progression (such as the first V—I in 7.24) does not
perform the function of articulating a group ending. This condition 1s
global, in that it depends on the outcome of higher-level analysis.

These considerations can be summed up in a final statement of the
preference rule for cadences:

TSRPR 7 (Cadential Retention) If the following conditions obtain in a

time-span T, then label the progression as a cadence and strongly prefer

to choose it as head:

i. There 1s an event or sequence of two events (e1)e, forming the pro-

gression for a full, half, or deceptive cadence.

i. The last element of this progression is at the end of T or is prolonged
to the end of T.

ili. There is a larger group G containing T for which the progression can
function as a structural ending.

Retention of Structural Beginnings
The articulation of structural beginnings of groups is in part symmetrical
to the use of cadences at the ends of groups. But since there are no
formulaic progressions to mark the beginnings of groups, a preference
rule for structural beginnings need contain no condition analogous to
condition ¡ of the cadence rule. Moreover, though the resolution of a
cadence must be prolonged to the end of its group, a structural beginning
may be preceded by contrasting material.

However, groups in which the structural beginning is not near the
actual beginning are felt as distinctly less stable. There seems to be a
preference for the structural beginning to be near the beginning:

TSRPR $ (Structural Beginning) If, for a time-span T, there is a larger
group G containing T for which the head of T can function as structural
beginning, then prefer as head of T an event relatively close to the begin-
ning of T (and hence to the beginning of G as well).

Note the parallelism between the condition in this rule and condition
ili of the cadence rule above. They are both “top-down” conditions,
concerning the function of the chosen event within the larger structure of
the piece. It is these two rules that embody the importance of structural
beginnings and endings of groups within the present theory of musical
grammar.

Examples To make the operation of TSRPRs 7 and 8 clearer, let us work
through the larger levels of reduction for some examples. We begin with a
