a group it is heard as a full cadence—either “feminine” or “masculine,”
depending on whether the V or the I is metrically more accented. If a
grouping boundary intervenes between the two chords, the V does not
resolve into the l; instead the V ends a group and is heard as a half
cadence, and the lis heard as launching a new phrase. Metrical structure
alone cannot account for these discriminations, precisely because it has
no inherent grouping. Both components are needed.

This completes our argument that the properties of grouping and meter
must be kept separate. En route we have also shown that some funda-
mental rhythmic features— patterns of metrical accentuation in group-
ing, upbeats and afterbeats, aspects of cadences—emerge in a direct and
natural way when the components interact. Now we need to generalize
their interaction in terms of time-span structure.

Although time-spans can be drawn from any beat to any other beat,
the only time-spans that have relevance to perceived metrical structure
are those drawn between successive beats at the same metrical level; these
spans reflect the periodicity inherent in metrical structure. The hierarchy
of such spans can be represented by brackets as shown in 2.16, where a
bracket begins on a given beat and extends up to (but does not include)
the next beat at that level.

Groups, of course, also take place over spans of time. But in this case,
even though a group begins on a given beat and extends up to another
beat (the norm in tonal music, in which even the smallest detail is almost
always given a metrical position), there is no prior restriction that the
group extend between beats at the same metrical level. A group can have
any arbitrary length. If, however, a group does extend between beats at
the same metrical level, and if the first beat in the group is its strongest
beat, then the span produced by the group coincides with a metrical
time-span. An instance of this common phenomenon appears in 2.17a,
where the span for the third level of dots is coextensive with the smallest
grouping span.
