The Tree Notation
for Reductions

Besides, it is not clear to us how such an approach would address cogni-
tive issues.

We have found it far preferable to reverse the generative process from
elaboration to reduction. This allows us to begin not by trying to justify a
prior model, but by directly investigating actual musical surfaces and
seeing what reductional structures emerge. If the results turn out like
Schenkerian analyses, fine; if not, that too is interesting. This strategy
permits us to ask, “What reduction or reductions does an experienced
listener infer from a given musical surface, and by what principles?” In
our view, this is the central question about reductions.

This strategy is consistent with our approach to rhythmic structure in
chapters 2-4. It is also consistent with the methodology of generative
linguistics, for, despite the term “generative,” the goal in linguistic theory
is to find the rules that assign correct structures to sentences. Con-
seguently the sentences as such in linguistic theorizing are usually taken
as given (recall the discussion in section 1.2 on misconceptions about
generative grammar). In addition, our strategy is amenable to experi-
mental methods in cognitive psychology, in which subjects are typically
given a “stimulus object” (such as the musical surface of an existing
piece) to which they react under controlled conditions. We want our
theory to be testable.

This is not to preclude the possibility that a sophisticated alternative
approach of constructing computational rules to “compose” pieces might
not also be valuable. It is conceivable that such an enterprise could
dovetail with our theoretical paradigm.

To construct reductions one must have an adequate notation. Schen-
kerian notation, though attractive, is not explicit enough; it typically
combines a number of levels at one putative level (“background,” “mid-
dieground,” or “foreground”), it often does not show what is an
elaboration of what, and it utilizes too many signs (beams, slurs, quasi-
durational values) to express similar relationships. The formal nature of
our inquiry necessitates a completely unambiguous and efficient nota-
tion, one that reflects in a precise way the hierarchical nature of reduc-
tions. To this end it is convenient to borrow from linguistics the notion of
a “tree” notation.

The notion, however, cannot simply be transferred, because linguistic
syntactic trees relate grammatical categories, which are absent in music.
This basic fact is one of the crucial differences between language and
music. All natural languages have nouns, verbs, adjectives, and the like.
Linguistic trees represent is-a relations: a noun phrase followed by a verb
phrase is a sentence, a verb followed by a noun phrase is a verb phrase,
and so forth. There is no musical equivalent to this situation. Rather, the
fundamental hierarchical relationship among pitch-events is that of one
