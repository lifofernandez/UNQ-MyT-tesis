six metrical levels in a piece. The notated meter is usually a metrical level
intermediate between the smallest and largest levels applicable to the
piece.

However, not all these levels of metrical structure are heard as equally
prominent. The listener tends to focus primarily on one (or two) inter-
mediate level(s) in which the beats pass by at a moderate rate. This is the
level at which the conductor waves his baton, the listener taps his foot,
and the dancer completes a shift in weight (see Singer 1974, p. 391).
Adapting the Renaissance term, we call such a level the tactus. The
regularities of metrical structure are most stringent at this level. As the
listener progresses away by level from the tactus in either direction, the
acuity of his metrical perception gradually fades; correspondingly,
greater liberty in metrical structure becomes possible without disrupting
his sense of musical flow. Thus at small levels triplets and duplets can
easily alternate or superimpose, and at very small levels—imagine, say, a
cascade of 32nd notes— metrical distinctions become academic. At large
levels the patterns of phenomenal accentuation tend to become less dis-
tinctive, blurring any potentially extrapolated metrical pattern. At very
large levels metrical structure is heard in the context of grouping struc-
ture, which is rarely regular at such levels; without regularity, the sense of
meter is greatly weakened. Hence the listener's ability to hear global
metrical distinctions tapers and finally dies out. Even though the dotsin a
metrical analysis could theoretically be built up to the level of a whole
piece, such an exercise becomes perceptually irrelevant except for short
pieces. Metrical structure is a relatively local phenomenon.

Problems of Large-Scale Metrical Structure
It may be objected that the listener measures and marks off a piece at all
levels, and that metrical structure therefore exists at all levels of a piece.
For example, the listener marks off a sonata movement into three parts;
the time-spans created by these divisions form the piece's basic propor-
tions. In reply, we of course acknowledge such divisions and proportions;
the question is whether these divisions are metrical, that is, whether the
listener senses a regular alternation of strong and weak beats at these
levels. Does he really hear the downbeat beginning a recapitulation as
metrically stronger than the downbeat beginning the development, but
metrically weaker than the downbeat beginning the exposition? We argue
that he does not, and that what he hears instead at these levels is grouping
structure together with patterns of thematic parallelism, cadential struc-
ture, and harmonic prolongation. As will be seen, all these factors find
their proper place in our theory as a whole, and together account for the
sense of proportion and the perception of relative large-scale “arrival” in
a piece.5

To illustrate the difficulties involved in large-scale metrical analysis, let
us see how far we can carry the intuition of metrical structure in a not
