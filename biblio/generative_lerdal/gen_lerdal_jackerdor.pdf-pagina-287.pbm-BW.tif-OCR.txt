machinery, for which there is no evident survival value. A conceivable
answer might be that many of the principles of musical grammar are not
specific to music; that musical grammar is a confluence of a number of
factors independently needed for more essential aspects of cognitive abil-
ity. (There might, nevertheless, be a residue of musical cognition thatis a
product of nonadaptive evolutionary accident.) We have already men-
tioned a few such possibilities: the principles of grouping (section 3.2),
the use of stress (phenomenal accent) and length as indications of accent
in both music and language (section 4.2), and the phenomenon of audi-
tory stream segregation and its relation to fusion in time-span reduction
(section 7.2). Chapter 12 will explore such correspondences in more
detail.

However, such an argument does not make musical grammar any
simpler; it just shows that musical grammar, in all its richness, need not
be isolated from the rest of cognition. In fact, it should be worthwhile to
pursue these connections in the opposite direction, using the complexity
of musical grammar as evidence for the complexity of cognition in
general.

To buttress our claim for the complexity and hence the possible innate-
ness of much of musical intuition, we summarize in this section the
contributions of our theory to an area commonly thought to involve
“natural” abilities: musical rhythm. lt is also an area where musical
properties carry over to other dimensions of human experience. In addi-
tion, this overview provides the opportunity from a purely musical stand-
point for gathering together ideas, scattered throughout the book, on a
topic of great importance.

At the beginning of chapter 2 we implied that many writers have
treated the subject of rhythm inadequately because they have tried to
reduce its many aspects to a few simple notions. We have proposed
instead that rhythm is multidimensional and interactive. Below are the
aspects of rhythm that our theory addresses. Some of these aspects
emerge directly as part of the structural description assigned to a piece by
the formal grammar, others indirectly as interpretations based on the
structural description.

1. The grouping component assigns the segmentation into musical units
inferred by the listener from the musical surface. The local hierarchical
distortions of overlap and elision are given special treatment within
the grouping component by means of transformational rules.

2. The metrical component assigns the pattern of strong and weak beats
heard by the listener. Metrical accents are distinguished from phenom-
enal accents, which are an input to metrical structure, and structural
accents, Which are represented in time-span reduction. Syncopation
arises when phenomenal accents conflict with the inferred metrical
