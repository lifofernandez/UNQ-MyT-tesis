structures into surface structures. In our music theory the well-formed-
ness rules describe hierarchical organizations that correspond roughly to
linguistic phrase structure, and, as mentioned earlier in this section, the
musical transformational rules are analogous to linguistic transforma-
tions (though, as mentioned in section 3.4, the operations they perform
more closely resemble phonological than syntactic transformations).
Therefore, to the limited extent that musical transformational rules are
necessary — such as for grouping overlaps and elisions, metrical deletions,
and missing harmonic functions —our theory does embody a notion of
“deep structure”; the transformations convert underlying disentangled
overlaps and the like into the musical surface.

For some, there might be an intuitive sense in which “deep structure”
implies a representation of simple, normative, archetypal forms. While
rejecting the applicability of the term in this sense, we agree that the study
of archetypal patterns is a matter of serious interest. All experienced
listeners intuitively apprehend a phrase, for example, as relatively normal
or unusual.

It might be supposed that an archetypal pattern is best systematized in
terms of a deep structure (in the technical sense), which would then be
converted by means of transformational rules into the musical surface.
For example, a five-measure phrase might be seen as derived from a
deep-structural four-measure phrase, a noncongruent phrase such as the
opening of Mozart K. 331 might be seen as derived from a congruent
phrase, and so forth. One can see versions of such derivations, in varying
degrees of formality, in Schenker 1935, Komar 1971, Snell 1979, Keiler
1978a, and Schachter 1980. Although such an approach seems initially
plausible, we have found it impracticable both musically and formally.
Musically, it is easy to conceive of rather simple irregularities such as
five-measure phrases and harmonic substitutions as distortions from an
archetypal form; but in dealing with a passage of any complexity or
length it is hard to specify what archetype the music is a transformation
of. This musical difficulty is reflected in a formal difficulty similar to the
one concerning thematic transformations: in order to derive various sur-
face structures from a deep structure, it would be necessary to admit an
almost unconstrained class of permissible transformational derivations.
Furthermore, there are the problems of positing a universe of archetypal
forms, choosing the correct deep structure for any complex piece, and
systematically specifying the derivation from archetype to musical sur-
face for any given passage. None of the approaches cited above makes a
serious attempt to solve this collection of formal difficulties.

Rather than develop an archetypal deep structure, with its attendant
problems, we propose (as hinted in section 3.6) that archetypal patterns
emerge as a consequence of the preference rules for the four components
of the musical grammar. A passage in which the preference rules maxi-
