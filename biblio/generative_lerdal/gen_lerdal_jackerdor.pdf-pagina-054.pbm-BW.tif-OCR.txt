In a case such as 3.21b, where there are six small groups, GPR $ cannot
apply in the ideal fashion. The ideal can be achieved in the relation
between the small and intermediate-level groups, or in the relation be-
tween the intermediate-level and large groups, but not both. The result is
an ambiguous intermediate-level grouping, shown as analyses ¿ and i in
3.21b. In a real piece the ambiguity may be resolved by metrical or
harmonic considerations, but then the result is not due solely to GPR 5. In
general, it is the impossibility of fully satisfying GPR $ in ternary group-
ing situations that makes such groupings somewhat less stable than bi-
nary groupings.

In the Mozart passage (example 3.19), GPR $ has effects of two sorts.
First, it reinforces GPR 4 (the intensification rule) in marking transition
10-11 as a larger-level boundary, since this divides the passage into two
equal parts. Second, the resulting intermediate-level groups each contain
three groups, the first two of which are two quarter notes in duration and
the third four quarter notes. GPR $ therefore groups the first two together
into a group four quarter notes in duration, producing the ideal subdivi-
sion of all groups. (Note that GPR $ does not require all groups to be
subdivided in the same way; it is irrelevant to GPR $ that the first and
third four-quarter-note groups are subdivided but the second and fourth
are not.)

In addition to GPRs 4 and 5, a third very important principle is in-
volved in the larger-level grouping of 3.19: the motivic parallelism of
events 1-10 and 11-20. We can isolate the effects of this principle in
passages such as those shown in example 3.22.

3.22

 

Other things being equal, 3.22a is most naturally grouped in threes and
3.22b in fours. Since both examples have uniform motion, articulation,
and dynamics, the grouping preference rules so far make no prediction at
all about their grouping. Hence a further preference rule is necessary to
describe these intuitions. We state it as GPR 6.
