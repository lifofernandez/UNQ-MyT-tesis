changes to forte are preferably heard as stronger than the changes to
piano, because the sudden forte functions as a local stress and triggers
MPR 4.)

We can account for the fact that this is heard most naturally as 6/8, with
strong beats at the changes in dynamic, by extending MPR $ so it counts
the length of a particular dynamic as a kind of length indicative of metri-
cal structure. Then MPR $ will apply at the changes ín dynamics in 4.24,
setting up a preference in metrical structure. In other words, from the
point of view of MPRs 4 and 5, example 4.24 behaves analogously to
4.25,

The spacing of changes of intensity establishes a preferred quarter-note
level: both passages in 4-26 are preferably in 3/4, with quarter-note beats
on the changes of dynamics. However, the two passages differ in the
factors determining where the strong beats of the quarter-note level lie.

From the point of view of MPRs 4 and 5, the passages are equivalent to
the durational patterns at the bottom of the example. In 4.26a the forte
lasts longer than the piano, so MPR $ says that the onset of the forte
should be relatively stronger. In addition, the stress perceived at the onset
of the forte reinforces the impression of a strong beat. Hence structure ¿ is
far more natural than structure ¿i. On the other hand, 4.26b has reversed
