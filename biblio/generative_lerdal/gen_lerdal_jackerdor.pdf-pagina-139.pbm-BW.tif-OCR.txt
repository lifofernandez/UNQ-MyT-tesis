Bild” would become a i-VI-i progression. Though such harmonic rela-
tionships are important, they are idiosyncratic, and they obscure the
generalization that virtually every tonal piece progresses from the tonic to
a full cadence on the tonic. The most global levels of reductions should
represent relations characteristic of the tonal ¡idiom as a whole. Relations
characteristic of a particular piece should begin to emerge at somewhat
more intermediate levels, showing precisely how the piece is a unique
instance of the tonal idiom.

Granting, then, cadential labeling and the resulting dominance of the b
and c over all other events within a phrase, let us see how the bs and cs of
different phrases interact to produce larger hierarchies. Here it will be
