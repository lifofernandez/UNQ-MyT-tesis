harmonic rhythm is significant in choosing 7.20b over 7.20c—as we be-
lieve it is—we might state a preference rule such as “Prefer a time-span
reduction with harmonic changes on relatively strong beats.”

But this formulation can be improved if we recall that there is a met-
rical preference rule (MPR 5Sf) that addresses the effect of harmonic
rhythm on metrical structure: “Prefer a metrical structure in which rela-
tively strong beats are associated with the inception of relatively long
durations of harmony in time-span reduction.” If the time-span reduc-
tion of 7.20a were 7.20c, MPR Sf would create pressure for placing the
strongest beat of the passage at the beginning of the second measure,
conflicting with other metrical evidence. By contrast, reduction 7.20b
creates no such pressure, because all the harmonies are of equal length.

This suggests that the choice of 7.20b is influenced by the fact that
it permits a less highly conflicted metrical analysis. In other words, in
addition to a metrical preference rule that considers metrical effects on
time-span reduction, there is a time-span reduction preference rule that
considers time-span effects on metrical structure:

TSRPR $ (Metrical Stability) In choosing the head of a time-span T,
prefer a choice that results in more stable choice of metrical structure.

Though the reasoning that leads to TSRPR $ is less direct than that
involved in the preliminary formulation above, we find TSRPR 5 a more
theoretically satisfying proposal, in that it claims that harmonic rhythm
affects time-span reduction not according to an arbitrary additional prin-
ciple but by means of the effect that time-span reduction is independently
known to have on metrical structure. TSRPR 5 therefore creates one of
the pressures that helps the strong metrical position of the “vi7” override
its harmonic instability.

The second factor involved in the choice of 7.20b is the stepwise mo-
tion of the bass that emerges in 7.20b but not in 7.20c. Similar linear
factors were used implicitly in the reduction of “O Haupt” in 7.17. For
instance, in the first half of the first measure, there is a choice berween a
IV on the first beat and a I5 on the second. Example 7.21 presents the two
possibilities.
