12.5
Music Theory as
a Cognitive Science

332

Recently a composite discipline called “cognitive science” has been
emerging out of parts of psychology, linguistics, neurophysiology, phi-
losophy, and computer science. As its name implies, this discipline is
concerned with characterizing the cognitive capacities of humans and
other organisms. Perhaps its most important goal is to understand the
nature of mental representation. Insofar as the goals we have set for the
present study are consistent with such a program of research, we have in
effect claimed for music theory a place among the branches of cognitive
science.

Our approach to music theory has not been concerned with questions
of memory capacity, real-time processing, brain localization, and the like.
We have restricted ourselves to a formal characterization of the listener's
intuitions about musical structure (that is, of his mental representation of
music). Although the theory is far from complete, it is detailed enough
and explicit enough to account for a rich range of musical intuitions,
from very elementary ones about grouping and meter to very sophisti-
cated ones involving prolongational structure. That alone would suffice
to justify music theory as a cognitive science.

Though it could have been the case that musical cognitive capacity had
nothing in common with other aspects of human behavior about which
anything is known, this chapter has shown that music theory begins to
bridge the gap berween two other capacities that have been studied much
more extensively: visual perception and language. Moreover, the strong
parallel between time-span reduction and prosodic structure appears to
provide the starting point for a more general theory of temporal pattern-
ing. That our study has managed to touch base with visual and linguistic
theory in such a striking fashion is in itself a vindication of the idealiza-
tions implicit in our approach.

Thus music theory is by no means a curious side branch of cognitive
science. We believe we have shown that it can provide central evidence
toward a more organic theory of mind.
