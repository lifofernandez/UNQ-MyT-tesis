Having shown that the theory of musical grouping is an instance of
Gestalt theory, what are we to make of this relationship? This question
must be approached with a certain amount of care, in view of the present
status of the Gestalt tradition: though its importance is widely acknowl-
edged, it has hardly been prominent in the literature of the past quarter
century. If we are to attach any significance to the similarity of musical
grammar and the Gestalt theory of vision, it seems wise, if only for
self-protection, to ask why Gestalt psychology has lost influence.

The sociological (irrational) difficulties have already been largely over-
come. One gets the impression that Gestalt theory could not withstand
the powerful antimentalistic bias prevalent in American psychology dur-
ing the 1940s and 1950s, and it seems to have been written out of
existence by the more “scientific” behaviorist school. Similarly, in the
psychology of music, Seashore's (1938) behaviorism was far more presti-
gious than Mursell's (1937) Gestalt-influenced work. Now the shoe is on
the other foot. The success of generative linguistics has played a large role
in rekindling interest in mentalistic theories, while behaviorist psychol-
ogy has been to a great extent discredited by arguments rather similar to
those advanced 40-60 years ago by the Gestaltists. (Chomsky 1959
seems to have been a significant turning point.) Thus the atmosphere is
now more conducive to a sympathetic reading of Gestalt work than it has
been in the past.

More substantive difficulties with the Gestalt tradition arose from the
problem of how to couch a mentalistic theory in a rigorous and explana-
tory fashion. First, it was felt (perhaps partly in response to behavioristic
arguments) that no mentalistic theory could be worthwhile without an
account of its mechanism, and in this respect Gestalt theory, like all
psychological theories past and present, was unquestionably deficient.
Koffka compares the Law of Prágnanz to physical principles that mini-
mize energy at boundaries berween substances. Kóhler 1940 tries to
make this sort of analogy into a theory by claiming a direct correspon-
dence between the stabilization of perceptual fields and the stabilization
of electrical fields in the brain. But, as has been widely recognized, this
physiological reduction is far too crude for the finely tuned observations
it is meant to explain.

Generative linguistics has again prepared the way for a resolution of
the problem, by demonstrating the virtues of dividing a psychological
theory into description of knowledge (competence model), description of
mechanism (performance model), and physiological reduction. It has
come to be widely accepted that a theory may address only competence
(as much linguistic theory does) or only competence and performance (as
many theories in psycholinguistics and artificial intelligence do), and still
be of great explanatory value. Thus Gestalt theory may now be regarded
as a theory of knowledge or of processing, which frees it of the stigma of
its weak attempts at physiological explanation.!
