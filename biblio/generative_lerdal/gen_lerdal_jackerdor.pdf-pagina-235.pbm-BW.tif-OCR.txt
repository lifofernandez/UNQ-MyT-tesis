V* through the influence of PRPR 2. In either case, by parallelism with
measure 1 (PRPR 5), the V3 finally attaches as a right branch to the preced-
ing VS. Example 9.17 gives the complete tree for both possibilities, with
9.17a deriving from branching a in 9.16 and 9.17b deriving from
branching b.

Both trees in 9.17 are musically meaningful. That in 9.17a captures the
double neighboring motion in the voice leading of the phrase—the V*
within a prolonged I and the “vi7” within a prolonged V“. On the other
hand, that in 9.17b better represents the pattern of tension and relax-
ation in the phrase, with the “vi7” and the second V* relaxing into the
following I.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now let us turn to our promised comment on motivic structure. Al-
though the rule of parallelism (PRPR 5) creates parallel internal structure
for parallel motives, it does not necessarily prevent a situation like 9.18a.

In this tree the two occurrences of the motive are internally parallel (in
that the second half of each is subordinate to the first half), but the
second occurrence is prolongationally an elaboration of an internal part
