TSRWER 2 If T does not contain any other time-spans (thatis, if Tis at
the smallest level of time-spans), e is whatever event occurs in T.

TSRWER 3 If T contains other time-spans, let T;,...,T, be the (regular or
augmented) time-spans immediately contained in T, and let e,,...,e, be
their respective heads. Then the head of T is one of the events e,,...,en.

Observe how the Strong Reduction Hypothesis is incorporated into
these rules. First, the segmentation rules guarantee that a piece is ex-
haustively segmented into time-spans, arranged hierarchically from the
smallest metrical level up to the level of grouping encompassing the entire
piece. Second, each time-span has a head, chosen from the heads of those
time-spans it immediately contains. This method of choice guarantees
that each level of reduction can be constructed from the next smaller level
and does not have to refer to events eliminated at earlier stages of reduc-
tion. Hence these rules create a class of unified hierarchical structures for
the entire piece.

The rules just stated deal only with cases of reduction in which the
head of a time-span is a single event chosen from among the events in that
time-span. Let us call this situation ordinary reduction. Though the ma-
jority of situations produce ordinary reduction, three other sorts of heads
can also appear, resulting from reductional processes which we will call
fusion, transformation, and cadential retention. We take them up in turn,
before incorporating them into a final statement of the well-formedness
rules later in this section.

Fusion
This process can be exemplified by 7.10, a passage from the prelude of
the first Bach Cello Suite.

A reduction at the eighth-note level should obviously show the existence
of the rising line, but it should also reflect awareness of the pedal D.
Similarly, in an Alberti bass, the reduction should represent the fact that
one hears a single chord spread out over a time-span. If the rules for
selecting the head of a time-span were to allow only the selection of a
single event in a time-span, we would not be able to represent such
intuitions in a time-span reduction. Accordingly we will introduce an-
other possible relation between the head of a time-span and the events
within it: the head may be the fusion of the events into a single event; or,
conversely, the surface events may be an arpeggiation of the head.
