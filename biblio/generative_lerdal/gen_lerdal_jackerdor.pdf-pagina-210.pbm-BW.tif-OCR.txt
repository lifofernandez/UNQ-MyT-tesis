overlap and associated metrical deletion at measure 23 are given in their
underlying forms so as to facilitate the drawing of the tree.

A few analytic remarks are needed for the grouping and metrical anal-
yses in 8.33. An attractive feature of the theme is its characteristic 5-bar
(3+2) phrasing, created by the motivic extension of measure 2 into mea-
sure 3 (and similarly for measures 7-8 and 20—21). The most plausible
metrical analysis is one that is in phase with this 3+2 grouping analysis,
resulting in an irregular second row of dots for the first section (measures
1-10) and, by parallelism, for the reprise (measures 19—23). At measure
23 this interpretation requires the metrical deletion mentioned above.
Equally plausible for the reprise, however, is the metrical interpretation
placed in curly brackets; this more regular analysis follows “conserva-
tively” from the 4+4 contrasting section (measures 11—18), and leads
without complication into the coderta (measures 23—29). The choice is
berween parallelism and simplicity. In the “conservative” reading, the
cadential arrival at measure 23 is rhythmically especially satisfying be-
cause it permits the S-bar phrase finally to be heard in a metrically
periodic fashion.

Turn now to the tree in 8.33. Because the time-spans in the piece are
irregular and are more deeply embedded in its second half, the specific
designations for levels d and e are somewhat arbitrary. We have not
bothered to include branchings for events at levels smaller than level g.
The rest should be self-explanatory. On the whole, this is one of those
pieces where the time-span reduction is less valuable in itself than for its
role as an input to the prolongational reduction.

We will develop the prolongational reduction in stages from the time-
span reduction. Levels a and b in 8.33 yield the prolongational basic
form in 8.34a. At the next stage, level c in 8.33 offers one event for
prolongational analysis, the V in measure 11. However, the I in measure
19 appears at level d, only one level smaller than the V in measure 11;
and this 1, the beginning of the reprise, makes the closest possible connec-
tion with the opening I. Therefore, as shown in 8.34b, the Tin measure 19
must be selected as a prolongational repetition of the opening I, to which
the V in measure 11 then attaches as a departure. Though the tree in
8.34b represents a longer passage of music, the prolongational situation
is analogous to the standard antecedent-consequent structure shown in
8.17b. If we then add the essential remaining element of the cadential
nucleus for the final cadence, the “subdominant” ii5 in measure 22, the
resultant tree in 8.34c satisfies normative structure as well (compare
8.28b).

The next available events appear at level e in 8.33. First, the full
cadence in measures 9-10 prolongs the opening tonic (8.35a). (We have
