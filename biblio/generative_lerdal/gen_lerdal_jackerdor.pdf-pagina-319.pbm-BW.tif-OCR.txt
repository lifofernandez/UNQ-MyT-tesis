languages such as Turkish), and syllable structure proved resistant to
perspicuous treatment. A recent line of research in phonology, first pro-
posed by Liberman (1975) and Liberman and Prince (1977), has devel-
oped a theory of prosodic tree structures (sometimes also called metrical
siructures) that overcomes these difficulties. This theory has stimulated a
great deal of work developing and refining the initial formulation.* Al-
though there are several variants of the theory already in the literature,
enough basic agreement exists that we can present a composite version
that does justice to the literature and brings out those characteristics most
like time-span reduction.

It is well known that there are two simultaneous and independent
kinds of organization in the phonetic string— morphological and syl-
labic—and that these two do not divide up the phonetic string in the
same way. For example, the word originality divides up morphologically
as origin+al+ity, but syllabically as o+ri+gi+na+li+ty. Notice that
the syllables na and H cut across morpheme boundaries. Kahn (1976)
was the first to give a satisfactory theory of syllable structure in genera-
tive phonology; Chomsky and Halle (1968) had tried rather successfully
to do without the notion of syllable in their theory.

The rules determining position of word stress in various languages
often make use of distinctions among syllable types. This suggests that
stress rules should apply not to the simple phonological string, nor to the
morphological structure (as in Chomsky and Halle 1968), but to the
syllabic structure. Moreover, the existence of numerous languages that
place stress on every second (or third) syllable of a word suggests that in
these languages syllables are themselves organized into larger units,
which have been termed feet. The complete prosodic organization of the
word results from aggregating the feet together.

A tree notation developed in Liberman and Prince 1977 expresses the
aggregation of syllables into feet and of feet into words. In their notation,
each node of the tree dominates either a surface syllable or two other
branches, one strong (s) and one weak (1), For example, 12.9 illustrates
their tree structures for the English words reconciliatton and contractual.

The purpose of the s and w markings is to express relative degrees of
stress. In Chomsky and Halle 1968, as in previous traditions, stress was
marked numerically on vowels: [1 stress] was greater than [2 stress],
