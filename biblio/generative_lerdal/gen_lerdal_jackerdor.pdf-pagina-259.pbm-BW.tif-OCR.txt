anacrusis simply moves to a more stable event on the downbeat (tree
fragment a in 10.6).

In the second group, however, the event on the downbeat “resolves” to a
more stable event on the second beat (TSRPR 2), producing a second left
branch at the immediately smaller reductional level (tree fragment b).
This pattern then continues in the third group, in which the motive is
extended to produce a 2-bar group; the anacrusis to measure 3 itself
becomes a left branch to the anacrusis to measure 4 (tree fragment c).
(Note, incidentally, how inappropriate the cadence in measure 4 would
be if there were no appoggiatura; this is because it must “rhyme” in the
time-span reduction with measure 2.) Similar patterns-persist through-
out the second phrase (tree fragments 4', b', and c”). In the third phrase,
the pattern is expanded still further to encompass a 4-bar group (tree
fragment d). In all these cases (except for tree fragment a), the underlying
“gesture” is one of anacrusis to appoggiatura to resolution, with the
anacrusis elaborated in a progressive fashion, In a sense, this abstract tree
structure, together with its associated grouping and metrical structures, is
the real “motive”—a rhythmic motive— beneath the surface variety of
the music,.

Now we turn to the beginning of Beethoven's “Tempest” Sonata, op.
31, no, 2 (example 10.7), in which the same “linear motive” emerges
