different metrical structures (3/4 versus 6/8 and six possible positions for
the downbeat) are viable possibilities for beats 1-24. As Rosen 1972
points out (pp. 339-340), Haydn makes extensive use of this ambiguity
throughout the movement. The second half of the passage intuitively
rules out most of these possible analyses, but is itself full of metrical
complexity due to syncopation and cross-accents. In the course of our
analysis, we will show how the intuitive metrical complexity of the entire
passage is reflected in the application of metrical preference rules.

First consider the grouping. Parallelism and symmetry clearly establish
the grouping of beats 1—24 into sixes. Because of the counterpoint, the
grouping of the second half of the passage is somewhat more difficult to
motivate. However, it seems reasonable that the motivic parallelism be-
tween the first violin in the first four groups and the cello at 31-35 and
37-40 establishes the grouping illustrated, although this is to some ex-
tent in conflict with the grouping suggested by the inner parts between
about 28 and 40.

Beneath the eighth-note level of beats are marked the applications of
the metrical preference rules at this level. From 1 to 24, metrical evidence
at the eighth-note level is not highly differentiated. Since there are no
regularities at either two-beat or three-beat intervals, it is not at all obvi-
ous whether the six-note groups imply 3/4 or 6/8. Furthermore, though it
1s clear that the harmony changes somewhere in each group, it is not clear
where. In particular, the fact that each of the chords (6, 12, 18, and 24) is
immediately preceded by one ofits pitches suggests that the chords them-
selves are not the point of harmonic change. Hence no applications of the
harmonic-change rule (MPR Sf) can be marked with any certainty at this
level.

The first solid indications of meter are the attacks of long notes at 28,
30, and 36 and the clear harmonic changes at 30, 34, and 36, which
establish a spacing of metrical evidence consistent with a 3/4 meter. (The
harmony at 40 lasts only for a single eighth, so it does not constitute
evidence for MPR Sf, which looks for the onset of a prolonged harmony.)

Next, observe that in 40—48 the alternating quarter notes in the bass
and the upper parts create a generally high level of metrical evidence on
all beats. However, MPR 6 emphasizes the contribution of the bass,
establishing a differentiation that again favors spacing strong beats two
rather than three apart. Furthermore, the counterpoint sets up suspen-
sions at 44 and 46, creating pressure from MPR 38 to place strong beats
there.

All of this metrical evidence is consistent with the well-formed metrical
level shown as the quarter-note level in 4.40, and much more so than
with any other choice. Thus the second half of the passage, rich in metri-
cal evidence, forces the interpretation of the first half, which alone pro-
vides only meager evidence for a metrical interpretation.
