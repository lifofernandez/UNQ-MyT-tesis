mental, we get the opposition of dominant to tonic that is indispensable
to classical harmony. Then we can add to the vocabulary the dominant of
the dominant, the subdominant (whose second overtone is the original
fundamental), and so on. Eventually we have the complete system of
Western tonality, all allegedly arising from consonances generated by the
overtone series. So goes the argument of Bernstein (1976, pp. 35-37);
Helmboltz (1885) follows similar lines, with great care.

Closer examination reveals difficulties. There was indeed an early pe-
riod in the history of Western music in which the fourth was consonant
and the third dissonant. But not long after the introduction of the major
third as a consonance, a fourth between the bass and another part came
to be treated as dissonant, requiring resolution. This was its status in the
classical period. Furthermore, there is no way to derive the minor triad
from the overtone series. It is true that the minor triad can be thought of
as somewhat less stable than the major; historically, it was not until the
eighteenth century that pieces ended with any frequency on the minor
triad. But in the Classical period it was treated as a consonance. Since the
fourth (generated by the overtone series) is dissonant and the minor triad
(not generated by the overtone series) is consonant, derivation from the
overtone series is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for conso-
nance, even in the musical idiom most familiar to us.

Another argument of Bernstein (1976, pp. 27-29) concerns the sim-
plest version of the pentatonic scale (11.2), widespread throughout the
world,

11.2

This pitch collection is quite close to that provided by the first eight
overtones (1gnoring octave transpositions); hence the overtone series may
be thought to predict this scale directly. The one minor discrepancy is the
last note, A, which is to correspond to the sixth overtone of C, a flattened
Bb. What is not explained is why, in so many cultures, the A is not the
pure overtone but is much closer to the A of the diatonic scale, a fifth
above D. To argue that this is because the sixth overtone is “in the
cracks” of the natural scale and the ear has difficulty hearing it is in effect
to abandon the hypothesis of the primacy of the overtone series, replac-
ing with some other principle (probably the circle of fifths).

A further consequence follows from this hypothesis about the penta-
tonic scale: if an idiom has a smaller inventory of pitches, they should be
selected from those below the eighth overtone. Thus the most highly
favored system with only three distinct pitches should be the one in 11.3.
