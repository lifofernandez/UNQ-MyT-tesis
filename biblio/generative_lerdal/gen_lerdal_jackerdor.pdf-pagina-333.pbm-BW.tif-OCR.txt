virtue of being in the “strong” time-span 1—2 as opposed to the “weak”
time-span 3-4. The same argument applies to time-span reduction:
low-level elaborations of relatively important events are themselves no
more important than equally low-level elaborations of less important
events, In other words, strength relative to other time-spans inheres only
in the head and not in the time-span as a whole. Thus it would be
incorrect to change the interpretation of time-span trees to conform to
phonological theory.

On the other hand, it does make some sense to reinterpret prosodic
structure in time-span reductional terms. When main stress is applied to a
phrase on the basis of a prosodic tree, it is not spread over an entire
strong constituent but is applied to the designated terminal element (the
head) alone. Unstressed syllables are of equivalent strength whether they
are in a relatively strong or a relatively weak constituent. Hence aspects
of our argument against Cooper and Meyer's interpretation of metrical
weight in music are germane here, which suggests that the musical in-
terpretation of the hierarchical structures common to time-span and pro-
sodic theory is the correct one.

At first glance the notion that a phonological string has a reduction like
a musical string may seem rather odd. For example, the tree for reconcili-
ation (12.11) indicates a level of reduction of the form re—ci—a, one of
the form re—a, and finally one consisting of the main stressed syllable a
alone. This is hardly co1aprehensible in morphological, syntactic, or
semantic terms. However, at the phonological level of linguistic repre-
sentation, we are dealing not only with linguistic information but also
with its perceptual and motor organization. It is not at all impossible to
think of a prosodic reduction as determining the way a phonological
string is perceived, say by identifying relatively strong syllables first. It
could also affect the way a string is produced, say by treating the stronger
syllables as the axes around which other speech movements are mar-
shaled. If this is a plausible view, the parallelism between music and
language is still deeper.

General Implications

No matter how the discrepancies just discussed are eventually resolved,
the similarity berween the theory of time-span reduction and the theory
of prosodic structure seems to us to be a much more significant paral-
lelism between music and language than has ever, to our knowledge, been
pointed out. Its persuasiveness arises from the point-by-point correspon-
dence of abstract aspects of the proposed grammars, rather than from
superficial analogies berween the two media. To see the force of the ar-
gument, notice, by contrast, that similarities between syntactic and mu-
sical structure — for example, those proposed by Bernstein (1976) —have
not proved to be fruitful avenues of investigation. The differences be-
