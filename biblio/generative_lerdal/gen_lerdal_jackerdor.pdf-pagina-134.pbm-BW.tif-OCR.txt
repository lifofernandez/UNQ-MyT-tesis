Let us construct the tree step by step. Example 6.9 applies the princi-
ples of pitch stability to the events at the quarter-note time-span level. 1f
there is only one event in a span, its branch extends upward by a dotted
line, to be connected at a later stage to another branch. If there are two
events in the span, they attach as in 6.6a or 6.6b. As an aid, we label each
branching according to the paradigmatic situations shown in 6.7.

If we omit (“reduce out”) the events designated as subordinate in 6.9, a
single event remains as head of each time-span at the quarter-note level.
Example 6.10 is a convenient musical notation—a “secondary nota-
tion” —for representing this stage of analysis.

6.10

 

In this notation, if the head in 6.9 is on the weaker beat, it is placed in
6.10 on the associated stronger beat. This procedure expresses three
related intuitions: that an appoggiatura (in its broadest sense) is a struc-
tural delay, that strong beats “attract” stable events within a group, and
that the ear seeks, insofar as possible, a regular underlying harmonic
rhythm.

The next level in the time-span segmentation, the half-note level, con-
tains both regular and augmented time-spans (see 6.8). Example 6.11a
shows the branching for events in the regular time-spans; 6.11b shows it
for the augmented time-spans as well.

Observe how the levels of branching correspond to the levels of subgroup

bracketing. Again, the labeling specifies the paradigmatic situations from
6.7. Example 6.11c converts 6.11b into the secondary notation.
