immediately contained in the same segment z of the next larger level, the
branches corresponding to x and y are joined into a branch correspond-
ing to z; one of the two constituent branches is labeled s (strong) or w
(weak). If this process is carried out recursively, all the way to the largest
levels of segmentation, the result is a well-formed tree of the sort illus-
trated in 12.9 above, expressing the relative prominence of all the seg-
ments of the phonological string.? This process parallels exactly the
construction of a time-span tree.

Itis worth noting that the binary relationships the two trees express are
not strictly parallel. The relationship head versus elaboration in time-
span reduction trees is a relationship between events in the musical sur-
face; a branch in a tree represents a single event. For example, the
uppermost branching in the tree for a piece stands for a relation between
the piece's structural beginning and structural ending, not between its
first and second halves. By contrast, the relationship strong versus weak
in prosodic trees is a relationship between segments of the phonological
segmentation; each branch in the tree represents a syllable, foot, or word.
For example, the uppermost opposition of w and s in reconciliation
(12.9) is a relationship between recon- and -ciliation. We will discuss
below whether this disparity between the two theories is genuine, or
whether a more complete parallelism can be obtained.

So far we have simply constructed a set of possible prosodic trees
corresponding to a particular segmentation. What is needed in addition is
a set of rules of prominence to ascertain, for each branching in the tree,
which branch is s and which 1.

Prosodic Rules of Prominence

Each of the layers in the prosodic hierarchy has a characteristic rule or set
of rules for determining relations of prominence. Starting from the inner-
most layer, the aggregation of syllables into feet, the rule for English is as
follows (in present terms'0):

Prominence Rule 1

a. In a foot that immediately contains two syllables, the first syllable is
strong.

b. In a foot that immediately contains a foot and a syllable, the foot is
strong.

This rule results in the trees shown in 12.17 for flounce, modest, Pamela,
attire, vanilla, and America (the segmentation is from 12.13 and 12.14).
Recall that main stress goes on the syllable dominated only by ss.
