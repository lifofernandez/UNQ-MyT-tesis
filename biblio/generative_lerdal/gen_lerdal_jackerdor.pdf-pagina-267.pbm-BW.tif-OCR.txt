Let us see what this feature means in terms of tension and relaxation.
In the first half of the piece, each motion toward tension takes place at a
relatively large level (the prolongations of I in measures 4 and 19, the
tonicizing movement to V in measure 11). Each of these global tensings
subsumes strong local patterns of relaxing; twice these relationships are
further elaborated through anticipatory left weak prolongations (mea-
sures 5—7 to 8-11, measures 12-15 to 16-19). The very ending (mea-
sures 32-35) echoes these local patterns, specifically mirroring the
opening (measures 1—4).

The largest levels of the prelude exhibit the same pattern— only here,
after the tensing to measure 19, the relaxing pattern also occurs over long
spans of time. The music begins its final relaxation already at measure 20.
As the tree shows, this enormous expansion of the final cadence is ac-
complished by successive elaborations of the subdominant (measures 20—
23), the dominant (measures 24-—31), and the tonic (measures 32-35).
But such an expansion of the final relaxation could not be maintained if
local levels simultaneously relaxed; so here, especially in the elaboration
of the dominant (measures 24-—31), the prevailing local pattern is broken
by a series of tensing right branches. Thus the uncommon circumstance
