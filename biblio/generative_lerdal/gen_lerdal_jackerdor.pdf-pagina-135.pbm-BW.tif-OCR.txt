a and c the second. Remember that in b and d the head is on the weak
beat, whereas in a and c it is on the strong beat. In other words, an
important feature of the first phrase is that at various levels of detail the
more stable events occur on the weaker beats, until the phrase cadences

phrase, by contrast, at various levels of detail the more stable events
appear on the stronger beats; and when the phrase cadences, it happens
on a stronger beat than the cadence of the first phrase. The coherence of
each phrase individually, and the sense that the second answers the first,
depend crucially on these relationships between pitch and meter. (The
one exception, case b in measure 3 of 6.11a, is in itself revealing: in every
