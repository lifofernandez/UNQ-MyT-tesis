termediate event belongs to the adjacent event that shares its diatonic

collection.

The decision for right or left branching is more problematic for passing
motions within weak prolongations (thatis, within arpeggiations), where
the surrounding events are melodically and harmonically equidistant
from the passing event. Yet there is a sense in which the passing event
tenses or relaxes (as the case may be) primarily in relation to the domi-
nating event in the weak prolongation. For example, the V in 8.11a and
8.11bis heard primarily in relation to the 1, not the 15, resulting in a right
branch in 8.11a and a left branch in 8.11b. In the quasi- Ursatz in 8.11c,

the tensing from I to V 1s less salient than the relaxing from V to I so the
V connects to the Las a left branch.

Intuition is weakest for neighboring motions within strong prolonga-
tions, since the surrounding events are by definition identical in pitch
structure. However, as argued above, right or left branching for strong
prolongation can be decided from rhythmic factors. As a result, the rea-
soning about passing motion applies in a weaker form to neighboring
motion: the neighboring event tenses or relaxes more in relation to the
dominating event in its environment. Now, because strong prolongation
is almost always a right-branching structure, it follows that neighboring
motion is typically a right branch. This holds true whether the neighbor-
ing motion is a locally dissonant note (as in 8.12a), a neighboring chord
(8.12b), or, say, a large-scale neighboring motion extending over the B
