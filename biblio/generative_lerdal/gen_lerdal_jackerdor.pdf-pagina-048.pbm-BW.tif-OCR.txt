The effect of this version is to prohibit single-note groups except with
very strong evidence, and to prohibit two-note groups except with fairly
strong evidence. By three- or four-note groups, its effect would be imper-
ceptible. Put more generally, this rule prevents segmentation into groups
from becoming too fussy: very small-scale grouping perceptions tend to
be marginal.

The second preference rule involving local detail is an elaborated and
more explicit form of the principle of proximity discussed in the preced-
ing section. It detects breaks in the musical flow, which are heard as
boundaries between groups. Consider the unmetered examples in 3.14,

3.14

 

Our judgment is that, all else being equal, the first three notes in each
example are heard as a group and the last two are also heard as a group.
In each case the caret beneath the example marks a discontinuity between
the third and fourth notes: the third note is in some sense closer to the
second, and the fourth note is closer to the fifth, than the third and fourth
notes are to each other. In 3.14a the discontinuity is a break in a slur; in
3.14bitis a rest; in3.14c itis a relatively greater interval of time between
attack points. (The examples of proximity in the preceding section in-
volved a combination of the last two of these.)

In order to state the preference rule explicitly, we must focus on the
transitions from note to note and pick out those transitions that are more
distinctive than the surrounding ones. These more distinctive transitions
are the ones that intuition will favor as group boundaries.

To locate distinctive transitions the rule considers four consecutive
notes at a time, which we designate as , through . The sequence of
four notes contains three transitions: from the first note to the second,
from the second to the third, and from the third to the fourth. The middle
transition, 4,—73, is distinctive ¡f it differs from both adjacent transitions
in particular respects. If it is distinctive, it may be heard as a boundary
between one group ending with ; and one beginning with .

The distance between two notes can be measured in two ways: from
the end of the first note to the beginning of the next, and from the
beginning of the first note to the beginning of the next. Both these ways of
measuring distance contribute to grouping judgments. The formeriis rele-
vant when an unslurred transition is surrounded by slurred transitions, as
in 3.14a, or when a transition containing a rest is surrounded by transi-
tions without rests, as in 3.14b, The latter is relevant when a long note is
