Returning to 9.33, we see that the V/V at the end of the first theme-
group forms the most stable prolongational connection as a left branch,
as shown in 9.33b. This completes the exposition.

In the recapitulation, the beginning of the second theme-group forms a
different connection than in the exposition. Because it is a I rather thana
V, its most stable attachment is as a prolongation of the beginning of the
recapitulation. In turn, the end of the first theme-group, a V, is now
berween two ls, It may atrach to the earlier I because of congruence with
time-span segmentation (PRPR 2). However, it is more usual to hear this
event as leading into the second theme-group, by parallelism (PRPR 5)
with the exposition.

Putting together all these fragments, 9.30â€”9.33, we arrive at 9.35 as
the tree for the entire movement, This diagram expresses the structural
counterpoint between the major grouping divisions of the piece and the
major patterns of tension and relaxation.

PRPR 6 (normative structure) is the last of the rules of musical grammar
to be developed in this study. As this rule is the first to embody the
overarching influence of large-scale prolongational structure on the de-
tails of musical form, we regret having to break off our discussion of
musical grammar here. Still, there is something important to be learned
from our having taken so long to reach this point: how abstract musical
intuition is. If our theory of normative structure of musical phrases is
correct, the structure is specified in terms of relationships of prolonga-
tional connection among structurally significant events, not in terms of
any specified sequence of events. Moreover, the structurally significant
events are chosen in large part because of their importance in time-span
reduction, not just for their superficial melodic and harmonic content.
But time-span reduction itself represents a considerable degree of ab-
straction from the musical surface, since it crucially involves the grouping
and metrical structures, which in turn represent properties of the music
not directly presented in the surface sequence of pitch-events. We believe
that the great complexity of this mapping from the musical surface to
prolongational structure, and the comparative lack of prescriptive con-
straints wWithin that mapping, are among the deeper reasons why tonal
music is such a rich art.

Some readers may feel uneasy with the complexity of the apparatus we
have introduced to describe musical intuition, particularly that used to
derive prolongational structure. Beyond the sheer empirical power of the
theory to describe the characteristics of specific pieces and of tonal music
in general, we offer three arguments that support this complexity.

First, we have been careful to relate every step in our development of
musical grammar to musical intuition. The four components of musi-
cal structure each express a different aspect of musical intuition, and
