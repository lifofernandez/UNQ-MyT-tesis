structure must be triple or duple; it remains to find out which of the beats
within the pattern are heard as strong. Since the starting point for the
pattern sometimes affects judgments of metrical structure, optional notes
have been added at the beginning in some examples to indicate alterna-
tive starting points in cases where it might make a difference.

The use of repeating patterns as evidence for metrical structure de-
pends on the existence of a preference for metrical parallelism, which we
state as MPR 1.

MPR 1 (Parallelism) Where two or more groups or parts of groups
can be construed as parallel, they preferably receive parallel metrical
structure,

MPR 1 accounts for the fact that example 4.10a is preferably heard with a
metrical structure that repeats after four eighths, and 4.10b with a
structure that repeats after six eighths. Where the strong beats fall in
these patterns (and whether 4.10b is in 3/4 or 6/8) is still unclear.

Next consider a uniform sequence of equal-length notes of the same
pitch, such as in 4.11. No beat is more metrically prominent than any
other, and the sequence is totally vague metrically.

 

 

As in grouping, differentiation is required to establish perceived structure.

There is, however, a slight preference for hearing the starting point as
strong in 4.11. The generalization under which this judgment falls is
revealed more clearly by 4.12,

In this example one has a tendency to hear a strong beat on the A, though
one can easily heariit elsewhere. This effect is conneeted with the fact that
the downward leap after each D creates a succession of A-B-C-D se-
quences as the most plausible grouping. If one deliberately hears a less
favored grouping, such as B-C-D-A, the metrical structure is most nat-
urally heard with the strong beat on B rather than on A. Thus there seems
to be some connection between grouping and metrical structure besides
the ubiquitous factor of parallelism:
