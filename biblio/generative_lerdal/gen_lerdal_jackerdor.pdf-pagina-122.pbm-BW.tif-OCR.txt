the local tonic) of their roots on the circle of fifths, conjunct linear con-
nections are more stable than disjunct ones, and so forth.

Rhythmic Criteria and Time-Span Reduction

Granted all these criteria for relative pitch stability, we might now
hypothesize that the listener seeks maximal stability among pitch rela-
tions and mentally constructs pitch hierarchies (reductions) that express
such stability, Thus, if a pitch-event were adjacent to and less stable than
another event, it would automatically be subordinate to it. In other
words, according to this hypothesis, structural importance would be
equated with pitch stability.

But is this hypothesis adequate for the construction of a coherent
reduction? A glance at any tonal piece will reveal that it is not. For
example, in the first phrase of Mozart's Sonata K. 331 (5.10),7 the most
“stable” events are the four root-position tonic chords with C£ on top.
Purely according to pitch criteria, they must attach equally, because they
are identical; all other events, being less “stable,” must somehow be
subordinate to them. Among other things, this means that the cadential
dominant— even though it is the goal of the phrase—can do no better
than to attach as a right branch to the closest root-position I chord, as a
kind of afterthought to the phrase. The result is the partial tree in 5.10,
which is intuitively so ludicrous that we might as well discontinue the
exercise. Criteria of pitch stability may be necessary, but they are not
sufficient for the construction of reductions.

What other criteria are needed? Intuitively, the structurally most impor-
tant events in the phrase are its first and last events, the opening I and the
cadential V; as described in section 2.4, these are the structural accents of
the phrase.$ The intervening I chords are heard as comparatively local
phenomena: the one on the third eighth of measure 1 is a mere repetition
