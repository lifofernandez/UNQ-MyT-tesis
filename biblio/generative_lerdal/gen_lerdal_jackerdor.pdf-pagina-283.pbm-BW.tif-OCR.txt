the idiom simply do not give the rule opportunities to apply. An analo-
gous situation can be found in the visual arts: one would not claim,
because a particular artistic idiom made use only of black and white,
that the intended viewers could not make use of principles of color
perception.

A second kind of apparent counterexample might involve an idiom like
jazz in which cross-accents and syncopation are a prominent characteris-
tic. One might be tempted to claim that in such an idiom an accent or a
stress is indeed a mark of a weak beat, violating the putative universal.
However, closer examination suggests that such a solution would be
incorrect. The stylistic norm is not simply stresses on weak beats; it
consists rather of a number of strategies aimed at increasing local metri-
cal tension. The normal preference rules do not fail to apply; in fact they
are exploited as a means of creating the desired metrical tension, which
results from a conflict among rules. In short, the mere fact that a particu-
lar idom makes particular stylistic choices cannot itself contradict a
claim of universality for a rule; these choices may simply reflect the way
the idiom uses the interaction of universal rules to create interesting
musical structures.

A case can be made for genuine idiom-specificity of rules, however, Â¡f
there are two idioms for which similar aspects of the musical surface give
rise to distinct kinds of musical structure. Two obvious examples are the
rules for pitch stability and the metrical well-formedness rules. In the
former case there is no question that particular pitch configurations are
treated as consonant by one idiom and dissonant by another (see section
11.5). In the latter case an idiom that permits metrical regularities, say, at
a distance of seven beats (such as much Balkan folk music) will analyze as
metrically stable a passage that in classical Western tonal music would be
complex and irregular. Thus it is not hard to make a case for some
aspects of musical grammar being idiom-specific.

However, the idiom-specific features of the grammar we have devel-
oped seem to be considerably fewer than one might at first surmise.!
Though this may in part be a function of our own ignorance of other
idioms, we have shown why a superficial examination of another idiom
will not necessarily disprove our conjectures. To invalidate our claims, it
is necessary to demonstrate that our principles of grammar cannot be
applied to the idiom to yield analyses that correspond to the intuitions of
experienced listeners. This is a task of no less complexity in other idioms
than in classical Western tonal music. In short, a genuine test of our
claims of universality would appear to require serious historical and
ethnomusicological research.

Investigation of other idioms may be expected to yield a further ben-
efit. We have just noted that not all idioms make use of accentual distinc-
tions to which the metrical preference rules are sensitive. Similarly, many
idioms do not make use of pitch simultaneities (harmony), so that they do
