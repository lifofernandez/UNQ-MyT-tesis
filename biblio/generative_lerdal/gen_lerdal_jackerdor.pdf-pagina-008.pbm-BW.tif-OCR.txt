concerned only with the final state of his understanding. In our view 1t
would be fruitless to theorize about mental processing before under-
standing the organization to which the processing leads. This is only a
methodological choice on our part. It is a hypothesis that certain aspects
of the phenomena under investigation can be cleanly separated. Of
course, its value depends in the end on the significance of the results it
yields.3

The two idealizations we have adopted, that of the experienced listener
and that of the final state of his understanding, are comparable to ideal-
izations made elsewhere in cognitive psychology. Without some initial
simplification, the phenomena addressed by scientific inquiry have almost
always proved intractable to rational investigation.

Having outlined this goal for a theory of a musical idiom, we envision
a further sort of inquiry. A musical idiom of any complexity demands
considerable sophistication for its full appreciation, and listeners brought
up in one musical culture do not automatically transfer their sophistica-
tion to other musical cultures. And because one's knowledge of a musical
style is to a great extent unconscious, much of it cannot be transmitted by
direct instruction. Thus one may rightfully be curious about the source of
the experienced listener's knowledge. To what extent is it learned, and to
what extent is it due to an innate musical capacity or general cognitive
capacity? A formal theory of musical idioms will make possible substan-
tive hypotheses about those aspects of musical understanding that are
innate; the innate aspects will reveal themselves as “universal” principles
of musical grammar.

The interaction between this level of inquiry and a theory of a musical
idiom is of great importance. If a listener's knowledge of a particular
idiom were relatively uncomplicated (say, simply memorization of the
musical surface of many pieces), there would be little need for a special
theory of musical cognitive capacity. But the more the study of the lis-
tener's knowledge reveals complexity and abstraction with respect to the
musical surface, the more necessary a theory of musical cognitive ca-
pacity becomes; it is no longer obvious how the listener obtains evidence
for his structures from the musical surface. Thus a theory of a sufficiently
intricate musical idiom will be a rich source of hypotheses about psy-
chological musical universals.

In this book we develop a music theory along the lines suggested by
these general considerations. Specifically, we present a substantial frag-
ment of a theory of classical Western tonal music (henceforth “tonal
music”), worked out with an eye toward an eventual theory of musical
cognitive capacity. Our general empirical criteria for success of the theory
are how adequately it describes musical intuition, what it enables us to
say of interest about particular pieces of music, what it enables us to say
about the nature of tonal music and of music in general, and how well it
dovetails with broader issues of cognitive theory. In addition, we impose
