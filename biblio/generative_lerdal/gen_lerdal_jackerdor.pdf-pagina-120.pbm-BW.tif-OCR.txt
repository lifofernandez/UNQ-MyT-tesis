One might argue instead that subordinate events should appear simply in
berween structurally more important events at the next smaller reduc-
tional level, and therefore that a “network” notation (5.9c) is more ap-
propriate. In response, we observe that the sheer geometry of networks
creates insuperable notational difficulties once even a moderate number
of events are considered together; network notation is simply impracti-
cable for the analysis of real pieces. It would be preferable to allow, say,
just right branching, and interpret that as signifying plain insertion (for
example, to let 5,9a signify 5.9c). A more substantive reason for main-
taining both right and left branching is that it enforces the generally
pervasive intuition that subordinate events are elaborations of particular
dominating events, not just elaborations within a certain context. If this
restriction can be maintained for all cases, it represents a great advance
from a systematic point of view. Furthermore, the geometrical possibility
of right and left branching provides a significant opportunity for struc-
tural interpretation. The task is to establish interpretations for these
branchings that are both consistent and psychologically meaningful;
these are discussed in chapters 6 and 8. As will be seen, the reductional
components would be far less rich without these interpretations.

A second objection to the use of tree notation is more critical. Inherent
in the notation is that a specific branch leads to a specific pitch-event
(where by pitch-event we mean any pitch or group of simultaneous
pitches that has an independent attack point). Hence pitch structure is
seen as a sequence of discrete events. This leads to an excessively vertical
representation of musical experience; highly polyphonic music in par-
ticular is slighted, and basic voice-leading techniques, such a central con-
cern in Schenker's work, do not receive adequate treatment either. In
response, we observe that this objection pertains not to the tree notation
per se but to the very nature of hierarchical organizations, which by
definition are made up of discrete elements or regions. The difficulty is
not with the horizontal dimension as such, since the theory is as capable
of providing structural descriptions for individual lines as it is for har-
monic progressions. But in truly contrapuntal music there is an important
sense in which each line should receive its own separate structural de-
scription, Although it is possible in principle to extend the theory to
simultaneous multiple descriptions, the formal complications would be
so enormous that they would obscure the presentation of other, perhaps
more fundamental aspects of musical structure. We reserve such an ex-
tension for future research, (See section 10.4 for further discussion.)

A related objection concerns the fact that Schenkers underlying
voice-leading lines not only form counterpoints with each other, but also
have motivic content. Our concentration on a single tree for all voices
often shortchanges this aspect of musical structure. However, Schenker's
mature thought combines two modes of pitch organization, the hierar-
chical and the “linear-motivic” (for want of a better term). Since the
