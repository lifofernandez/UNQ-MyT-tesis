2. We have shown here only one of two possible grouping structures for sonata
form. The ambiguity concerns how the three groups consisting of exposition,
development, and recapitulation are to be further grouped. The grouping in 9.29
emphasizes the parallelism in endings between exposition and recapitulation, and
is similar to the grouping of the binary form out of which sonata form in part
grew historically (see Rosen 1980 on the origins of the sonata style). On the other
hand, an emphasis on the parallelism berween the beginnings of the exposition
and recapitulation would result in grouping the exposition and development
together. Such a grouping seems more typical of late classical sonata forms, in
which the development is balanced by a long coda to give four major sections
grouped by twos: exposition-development and recapitulation-coda. In such forms
the beginning of the recapitulation is usually a more dramatic point than in earlier
sonata movements, emphasizing the major grouping boundary; also, the repeat of
the exposition is often omitted, deemphasizing the group boundary berween it
and the development. The interested reader can verify, however, that the first two
steps in deriving the prolongational tree neutralize the grouping ambiguity: in
either grouping the prolongational structure is the same.

1. Andrew Imbrie has suggested this possibility (personal communication).

2. In the secondary notation in 10.7 we have quartered the note values beginning
at level g in order to show hypermetrical relations more clearly. This practice is
convenient only where hypermetrical bears are quite regular.

3. Along with these analyses should be mentioned the time-span reduction of
Schumann's song “Wehmur” in Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977, pp. 154—155
(though now we would prefer an our-of-phase analysis with hypermetrical beats
on the downbeats of odd, not even, measures). The prolongational reduction (pp.
156-157), on the other hand, represents an earlier and less satisfactory version of
that component, and should be disregarded.

4. “Guten Morgen, schóne Múllerin!
Wo steckst du gleich das Kópfchen hin,
Als wár" dir was geschehen?
Verdriesst dich denn mein Gruss so schwer?
Verstórt dich denn mein Blick so sehr?
So muss ich wieder gehen.”

5. Lewin 1974 discusses these musical-poetic relationships at great length and
with considerable insight. Aspects of our analysis duplicate Lewin's.

6. Schenker wants to bring out linear-motivic relationships involving third spans:
the ascending Ct—E and B—D in measures 1—2 elaborated into A—B—Ct in mea-
sures 3—4, combined with the descending E —D-—C£ in measures 1—4 followed by
D-Ctt—B in measure 4. Schachter (personal communication) has argued that this
in itself is enough to favor Schenker's analysis. Such a proposal might be incorpo-
rated into our theory by invoking another preference rule supporting prolonga-
rional reductions that emphasize linear-motivic connections of a certain kind. In
other words, it is a matter of weighting preference rules, involving once again the
problematic issue of parallelism. We, on the other hand, have tried as much as
possible to separate reductional and motivic structures; they are interactive, not
equivalent, modes of organization.
