sufficient precision that their consequences, both for and against the
theory, are as clear as we can make them.

The second argument against the theory is more substantive. The rea-
son that the rules fail to produce a definitive analysis is that we have not
completely characterized what happens when two preference rules come
into conflict. Sometimes the outcome is a vague or ambiguous intuition;
sometimes one rule overrides the other, resulting in an unambiguous
judgment anyway. We suggested above the possibility of quantifying rule
strengths, so that the nature of a judgment in a conflicting situation could
be determined numerically. A few remarks are in order here to justify our
decision not to attempt such a refinement.

First, as pointed out earlier, our main concerns in this study are iden-
tifying the factors relevant to establishing musical intuition and learning
how these factors interact to produce the richness of musical perception.
To present a complex set of computations involving numerical values of
rule applications would have burdened our exposition with too much
detail not involving strictly musical or psychological issues.

But our decision was not merely methodological. Reflection suggests
that the assignment of numerical values to rule applications is not as
simple a task as one might at first think. Winston (1970), in developing a
computer program for certain aspects of visual pattern recognition, uti-
lizes procedures not unlike preference rules. Because the computer must
make a judgment, Winston puts numerical strengths on the rules and sets
threshold values that rule applications must attain in order to achieve a
positive judgment. Winston himself notices the artificiality of this solu-
tion. For one thing, it allows only positive and negative judgments; not
ambiguous or vague ones, which we showed necessary in section 3.2.
Moreover, the choice of threshold values is to a certain extent arbitrary:
should the threshold be, say, 68 or 72? A simple numerical solution of
this sort provides an illusion of precision that is simply absent from the
data.

A more formidable conceptual problem lies in the need for the prefer-
ence rules to balance local and global considerations. Although it is not
hard to imagine numerically balancing the length of a rest against the size
of an adjacent change in pitch, it is much more difficult to balance the
strength of a parallelism against a break in a slur. Part of the difficulty
lies in the present obscurity of the notion of parallelism, but part also lies
in a lack of clarity about how to compare parallelism with anything else.
Even worse is the difficulty of balancing intercomponent considerations
such as those introduced by GPR 7, the rule of time-span and prolonga-
tional stability. How much local instability in grouping, or loss of paral-
lelism, is one to tolerate in order to produce more favorable results in the
reductions? Evidently, if we are to quantify strength of rule application,
nothing short of a global measure of stability over all aspects of the
structural description will be satisfactory. Thus we feel that it would be
