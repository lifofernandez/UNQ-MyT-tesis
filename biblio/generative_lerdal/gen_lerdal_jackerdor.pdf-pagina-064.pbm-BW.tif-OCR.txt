In 3.31a the intermediate level of grouping bisects one element of the
smallest level of grouping; in 3.31b the intermediate level of grouping has
an overlap and the smallest level does not; in 3.31c the small groups
overlap and the intermediate ones do not.

A more empirically sound alteration of the theory is to modify the
effects of GWER 4 in such a way as to make possible only those particular
types of violations that actually occur in music. To make the appropriate
modifications, we propose to distinguish two formal steps in describing a
piece's grouping structure. The first, underlying grouping structure, is
described completely by means of the grouping well-formedness rules of
section 3.1; that is, it contains no overlaps or elisions. The second step,
surface grouping structure, contains the overlaps and elisions actually
observed. These two steps are identical except where the surface group-
ing structure contains an overlap or elision. At points of overlap, the
underlying grouping structure resolves the overlapped event into two
occurrences of the same event, one in each group. At elisions, the under-
lying structure contains the event understood as being elided. Thus the
underlying grouping structure of a piece has two important properties: it
conforms to the GWFRs, and it explicitly represents the double function
of the overlapped or elided event.

The following rule expresses the desired relationship berween under-
lying and surface grouping structure for overlap. The last two conditions
in the rule are safeguards to ensure that all groups meeting at a boundary
are overlapped in exactly the same way. They prevent the rule from
creating situations like 3.31b and 3.31c, in which overlapping is not
uniform from one level to the next.

Grouping Overlap Given a well-formed underlying grouping structure
G as described by GWFRs 1-5, containing two adjacent groups g, and g>
such that

£1 ends with event e,,

£2 begins with event e,, and

€1 = €n,
a well-formed surface grouping structure G' may be formed that is iden-
tical to G except that

it contains one event e' where G had the sequence e¡e»,

e' = e = en,

all groups ending with e, in G end with e' in G', and

all groups beginning with e, in G begin with e' in G'.
