Furthermore, where 1s the prolongational head of this region, the Ft
minor arrival in measure 123, to attach? Of the possibilities available
from 10.18, it seems nonsensical to connect it as a departure from the
F major chord (measure 106) or as a direct progression to the V at the
end of the development (measure 138). Somewhat more plausible would
be to attach it as a direct departure from the V ending the exposition
(measure 89). Most plausible, by parallelism with the ensuing descending
circle of fifths (measures 123-133), would be to attach it to the B minor
chord in measure 125 (the dashed branch in 10.17); but this event is too
local in the time-span reduction to be available for prolongational con-
nection (PRPR 1).

Thus the rules in their present state do not predict an intuitively ade-
quate connection for this F$ minor complex. In a way this nonsolution
seems fitting, since as a tonal region it is both near to and remote from the
V prolongation within which it is embedded. It is near because it is the
relative minor within the prolongation; it is remote because of the way it
is approached. This ambiguity is reflected in the application of the rules.

We discern two general ways in which the prolongational component
might be further enhanced.

First, it should be possible to incorporate underlying voice-leading
features in a more satisfactory way. For example, in 10.15 the voice
leading of the melody would seem to be an unstable version of a more
stable structure. Specifically, the high C and B in measures 5 and 7 are
registral displacements, and the melody as a whole is composed of two
independent lines. If we fuse the F and the A in measure 1 (TSRWEFR 3b),
understand the B on the fourth beat of measure 2 to carry over into the
following downbeat (TSRWFR 3c), lower the C and the B in measures 5
and 7 an octave (by an as yet unstated transformational rule), and invoke
criteria about primary, subsidiary, and “contrapuntal” lines (single lines
that form two or more linear structures), 10.15 converts into the coher-
ent voice leading of the prolongational reduction in 10.19.

At level b it is apparent that the C in measure $ is an upper neighbor to
surrounding bs in measures 3 and 7. At level a the upper line emerges as a
linear ascent from 5 to $, over the more basic 3—2—1 descent (the whole
notes) in the middle voice.

There are three reasons why we have not yet developed this aspect of
pitch structure. First, we believe that principles of “coherent” voice
leading depend to a great extent on the rhythmic and reductional factors
already explicated in this book. To be sure, Schenker develops such prin-
ciples in a (for the most part) intuitively satisfying way; but to give a
rule-based account one must incorporate these other factors. We have
only now reached the point where this is possible. Second, to make
