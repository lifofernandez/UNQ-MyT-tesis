Preface

In the fall of 1973, Leonard Bernstein delivered the Charles Eliot Norton
Lectures at Harvard University. Inspired by the insights of transforma-
tional-generative (“Chomskian”) linguistics into the structure of lan-
guage, he advocated a search for a “musical grammar” that would
explicate human musical capacity. As a result of these lectures, many
people in the Boston area took a fresh interest in the idea of an alliance
between music theory and linguistics, and Irving Singer and David Ep-
stein formed a faculty seminar on music, linguistics, and aesthetics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall of 1974.

Our collaboration began as an outgrowth of that seminar. Consulting
each other during the preparation of our individual talks, we soon found
ourselves working together on an approach of some novelty. Our partici-
pation in the MIT seminar gave us frequent opportunities over the next
three years to present and discuss our work in its formative stages. In
addition, we had the good fortune to be invited in the spring of 1975 to a
week-long seminar on music and language at the Institute de Recherche
et Coordination Acoustique/Musique in Paris, organized by Nicolas
Ruwet. We have also had the opportunity to present aspects of our work
in talks at the Accademia Filarmonica in Rome, Brandeis University,
Columbia University, the University of California at Irvine, and Yale
University, and to the American Society of University Composers, the
New York State Theory Society, a Sloan Foundation Conference on Cog-
nitive Science, and the Third Workshop on Physical and Neuropsycho-
logical Foundations of Music in Ossiach, Austria.

In the course of preparing a written paper for the proceedings of the
IRCAM conference (this paper eventually appeared as “Toward a Formal
Theory of Tonal Music” in the Journal of Music Theory), we realized
that the material we had worked out required book-length exposition.
Hence this volume, written intermittently along with string quartets and
books on linguistic theory.
