This region contains eight events, from which we must choose an e; and
attach it. PRPR 1 favors the most time-span-important events—the first
V* and the “vi7.” PRPR 3, on the other hand, favors the I chord, since it
forms a strong right-branching prolongation with the initial I. Thus the
two rules are in conflict.

In analyzing numerous examples of this sort of conflict, we have found
that the following principle accounts for the vast majority of cases:

Interaction Principle In order to make a sufficiently stable prolonga-
tional connection, e, must be chosen from the events in the two most
important levels of time-span reduction represented in (e;—e;).

The Interaction Principle restricts the conditions under which PRPR 3 can
override PRPR 1: no matter what stable prolongational connection can be
made to the endpoints of a region, only those events in the highest two
levels of time-span reduction represented in the region can be considered
for ex. Thus the Interaction Principle is a more explicit version of Prolon-
gational Hypothesis 2, which states the dependence of prolongational
reduction on time-span reduction, and, through time-span reduction, on
grouping and metrical structure.

The Interaction Principle allows two levels of time-span reduction to
be available for e, rather than only one level, because a degree of flexibil-
ity must be allowed between time-span importance and prolongational
importance. On the other hand, the use of two levels rather than three or
more appears empirically to yield just the correct degree of looseness
between the two reductions; it prevents unimportant detail from playing
too great a role at any particular stage of prolongational analysis.!

We return now to the conflict in 9.12. According to the Interaction
Principle, the I chord may be chosen as ex, because it is only one time-
span level less important than the V* or the “vi7.” (On the other hand, in
the original K. 331 passage, the 1 chord on the third beat of measure 1 is
two levels less important than the VS, and so cannot be considered a
candidate for ex.) The tree resulting from the choice of the I is shown in
9.13.
