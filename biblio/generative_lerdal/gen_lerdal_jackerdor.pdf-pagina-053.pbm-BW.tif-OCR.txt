However, consider again the analysis in grouping b of 3.5, which has
all the low-level boundaries in the right place, but whose larger bound-
aries are intuitively incorrect. GPRs 1—3 do not suffice to prefer 3.1 over
grouping b of 3.5, since they deal only with placement of group bound-
aries and not with the organization of larger-level groups. Further prefer-
ence rules must be developed in the formal theory to express this aspect
of the listener's intuition.

Organization of Larger-Level Grouping

Beyond the local detail rules, a number of different principles reinforce
each other in the analysis of the larger-level groups in 3.1. The first of
these depends on the fact that the largest time interval between attacks,
and the only rest, are at transition 10—11, This transition is heard as a
group boundary at the largest level internal to the passage. The most
general form of this principle can be stated as GPR 4.

GPR 4 (Intensification) Where the effects picked out by GPRs 2 and 3 are
relatively more pronounced, a larger-level group boundary may be
placed.

A simple example that isolates the effects of GPR 4 from other preference
rules is 3.20, which is heard with the indicated grouping.

 

 

 

 

GPRs 2a and 2b (the slurfrest and attack-point rules) correctly mark all
the group boundaries in 3.20, but they say nothing about the second level
of grouping, consisting of three groups followed by two groups. GPR 4,
however, takes note of the fact that there is a rest at the end of the third
small group, strongly intensifying the effects of GPR 2 at that particular
transition, It is this more strongly marked transition that is responsible
for the second level of grouping.

A second principle involved in the larger-level grouping of example 3.1
is a general preference for symmetry in the grouping structure, indepen-
dent of the musical content:

GPR 5 (Symmetry) Prefer grouping analyses that most closely approach
the ideal subdivision of groups into two parts of equal length.

GPR $ is involved in the larger-level grouping of 3.21a in which the
smaller groups are further grouped two and two rather than, say, one and
three.
