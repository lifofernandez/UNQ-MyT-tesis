event at the appropriate time-span reductional level to the event at the
structural downbeat.

7. Prolongational reduction expresses one of the most basic rhythmic
intuitions: the breathing in and out, the tensing and relaxing, inherent
in the motion of pitch-events. This component places pitches in a
dynamic relationship. The different kinds of branching signify relative
degrees of tensing and relaxing. Normative structure supplies the
minimal branching structure for the tensing-to-relaxing motion fun-
damental to all tonal pieces.

8. The events contained under a prolongational branching complex can
be thought of as a prolongational grouping. Harmonic rhythm as
traditionally conceived is a special, surface instance of the interaction
of prolongational grouping with metrical structure. In this theory
harmonic rhythm is the durational pattern of all levels of prolonga-
tional grouping.

9. Time-span reduction and prolongational reduction can be in a congru-
ent or noncongruent relation to one another. Because time-span trees
correlate with grouping structure (via the segmentation rules), congru-
ence is best understood as the relationship berween events heard
within grouping structure and events heard within prolongational
groupings. The latter can cut across subphrase groupings, across
phrases, and across global segmentations, producing varying degrees
of noncongruence. Noncongruent relationships promote continuity
over division.

All of these features can, in a general sense, be termed “rhythmic.” Nor
is the list complete. First, it has not included the nuances of individual
preference rules and the ways they interact in a conflicting or reinforcing
fashion. Second, it has not included the rhythmic patrerns at the musical
surface: its patterns of attack points, durations, and rests; its patterns of
pitch-rhythmic repetitions and parallelisms. These features are an input
to the theory, not part of it. Yet these surface patterns themselves form
rich rhythmic relationships with all the inferred aspects of rhythmic
structure enumerated above, complicating the rhythmic picture still fur-
ther. Third, the rhythmic effect of contour patterns has not been dis-
cussed. Fourth, we have neglected the impact of timbral factors on
rhythmic perception. No doubt there are other rhythmic features that we
have not thought to mention here.3

It must be emphasized that none of the rhythmic features discussed
here is reducible to any other. One's intuitive understanding of, say, a
particular musical “gesture” is a product of the minute interaction of
these multifarious dimensions — their presence or absence, their conflict-
ing or reinforcing structures. As Seymour Shifrin once remarked, “Cross-
accentuation is the life-blood of rhythm.”
