assigns to the pitches a hierarchy that expresses harmonic and melodic
tension and relaxation, continuity and progression.

Other dimensions of musical structure—notably timbre, dynamics,
and motivic-thematic processes—are not hierarchical in nature, and are
not treated directly in the theory as it now stands. Yet these dimensions
play an important role in the theory in that they make crucial contribu-
tions to the principles that establish the hierarchical structure for a piece.
The theory thus takes into account the influence of nonhierarchical di-
mensions, even though it does not formalize them.

We have found that a generative music theory, unlike a generative
linguistic theory, must not only assign structural descriptions to a piece,
but must also differentiate them along a scale of coherence, weighting
them as more or less “preferred” interpretations (that is, claiming that
the experienced listener is more likely to attribute some structures to the
music than others). Thus the rules of the theory are divided into two
distinct types: well-formedness rules, which specify the possible struc-
tural descriptions, and preference rules, which designate out of the possi-
ble structural descriptions those that correspond to experienced listeners”
hearings of any particular piece. The preference rules, which do the major
portion of the work of developing analyses within our theory, have no
counterpart in standard linguistic theory; their presence is a prominent
difference between the forms of the two theories (see section 12.2 for
further discussion).

The need for preference rules follows from the nature of intuitive
judgments involved in motivating the theory. In a linguistic grammar,
perhaps the most important distinction is grammaticality: whether or not
a given string of words is a sentence in the language in question. A
subsidiary distinction is ambiguity: whether a given string is assigned two
or more structures with different meanings. In music, on the other hand,
grammaticality per se plays a far less important role, since almost any
passage of music is potentially vastly ambiguous—it is much easier to
construe music in a multiplicity of ways. The reason for this is that music
is not tied down to specific meanings and functions, as language is. In a
sense, music is pure structure, to be “played with” within certain bounds.
The interesting musical issues usually concern what is the most coherent
or “preferred” way to hear a passage. Musical grammar must be able to
express these preferences among interpretations, a function that is largely
absent from generative linguistic theory. Generally, we expect the mu-
sical grammar to yield clear-cut results where there are clear-cut intuitive
judgments and weaker or ambiguous results where intuitions are less
clear. A “preferred” structural description will tend to relate otherwise
disparate intuitions and reveal regular structural patterns.

Certain musical phenomena, such as elisions, require structures not
expressible by the well-formedness rules. These structures are described
