8.4
A Secondary
Notation

By contrast, the consequent phrase, analyzed in isolation in 8.29b, pro-
duces a basic form but lacks the right branch necessary for normative
structure. (If, by parallelism with the antecedent, the ii were analyzed as
a right-branching departure, the phrase would lack a subdominant ca-
dential preparation.) This absence of any significant tensing motion
makes the consequent in itself sound perhaps less complete than the
antecedent. Together, however, the two phrases produce a normative
structure, a basic form, and a prolongational repetition indicating the
reprise (8.29c). Each half needs the other for completion.

We have found that normative structure in particular constitutes more
than a descriptive generalization about prolongational trees. It is also an
active force in shaping prolongational relationships. Listeners intuitively
seek out this tensing-relaxing pattern even where contrasting hearings
might otherwise seem more viable. (Why this is so would make interest-
ing speculation; is it a Western cultural convention, or does it originate in
biological factors?) Therefore this principle must become part of the
formal grammar; we will return to it in section 9.6.

The prolongational trees are by now sufficiently complicated that it will
help to relate them to a secondary notation developed from ordinary
musical notation. For this purpose we will adapt two Schenkerian sym-
bols, the stemless note head and the solid or dashed slur. The stemless
note head is useful because it represents pitch-events but is durationally
and hierarchically neutral. The slurs reflect the connections and hierar-
chical distinctions conveyed by the tree.

Only the slurs require explanation. Suppose there are two “adjacent”
events x and y; for the moment it does not matter which is prolonga-
tionally more important. If they connect as a strong prolongation, a
dashed slur is drawn between them in the secondary notation (8.30a). 1f
they connect as a weak prolongation or as a progression, a solid slur is
drawn between them (8.30b, 8.30c). If their branches do not directly join
in the tree, no slur can be drawn between them (8.30d). Thus, given the
three events in 8.30€, slurs are drawn between x andz and between y and
z, but not between x and y; and similarly in 8.30f£, where no slur is drawn
between x and z.
