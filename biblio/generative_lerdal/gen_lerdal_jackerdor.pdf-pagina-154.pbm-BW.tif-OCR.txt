Note that the upbeat has disappeared from the rhythmic representation
at this level, as in 7.4, but the structural importance of the upbeat has
been expressed, as in 7.5. The reduction from 7.6b to the whole-note
level is then 7.6c, a root-position tonic followed by a full cadence.

Example 7.7 illustrates the application of segmentation rule 2 to a
more complex example, measures 6-8 of the finale of Beethoven's First
Symphony.

This passage is strongly out of phase, since the strongest beat, marked by
the entrance of the accompaniment, falls at the beginning of measure 8.
Moreover, the anacrusis is triply embedded. The first sixteenth is an
anacrusis to the second two at the eighth-note level; the first three six-
teenths form an anacrusis to the downbeat of measure 7 at the quarter-
note level; and the first three sixteenths plus all of measure 7 form an
anacrusis to the downbeat of measure 8 at the two-measure level. This
triple embedding is reflected in the time-span segmentation by the pres-
ence of three levels at which both a regular and an augmented time-span
exist. It is an important test of our theory of rhythm that it can express
this upbeat-within-upbeat intuition by elaboration of the technique used
to describe ordinary upbeats.

The time-span segmentation in 7.7 gives rise to the time-span reduc-
tion in 7.8, given in tree form and in secondary notation. The inclusion of
the initial G in the first augmented time-span of the eighth-note level
makes it possible for this note to be the most important event at the
beginning of this level and the next while still giving the reduction a
rhythmically satisfying form.?

A final comment on the segmentation rules: We surmise that they are
universal, except for one interesting ¡diom-specific variation. In classical
tonal music, the strong beat of a regular time-span falls at the beginning.
This seems to be the normal case across idioms. However, in the gamelan
idiom described in Becker and Becker 1979, it appears that the strong
beat is at the end of each subgroup. The typical grouping, metrical, and
subgrouping organization of this music is shown in 7.9,
