GWER 2 A piece constitutes a group.

The third rule provides the possibility of embedding groups, evident
in 3.1.

GWER 3 A group may contain smaller groups.

The next two rules state conditions on the embedding of groups within
groups.

GWER 4 Ifagroup G¡ contains part of a group G, it must contain all of
Ga.

This rule prohibits grouping analyses such as 3.2, in which groups
intersect.

3.2

In these examples G¡ contains part of G but not all of it. On the other
hand, all the groups in 3.1 satisfy GWER 4, resulting in an orderly em-
bedding of groups.

There are in fact cases in tonal music in which an experienced listener
has intuitions that violate GWFR 4. Such grouping overlaps and elisions
are inexpressible in the formal grammar given so far. However, since
overlaps and elisions occur only under highly specific and limited condi-
tions, it would be inappropriate simply to abandon GWFR 4 and permit
unrestricted overlapping of groups. Instead overlaps and elisions receive
special treatment within the formal grammar, involving transformational
rules that alter structure. We turn to these phenomena 1n section 3.4.

The second condition on embedding is perhaps less intuitively obvious
than the other GWERs. It is, however, formally necessary for the deriva-
tion of time-span reduction in chapter 7.

GWER 5 If a group G; contains a smaller group G, then G¡ must be
exhaustively partitioned into smaller groups.

GWFR $ prohibits grouping structures like those in 3.3, in which part of
G1 is contained neither in G nor in Gg.

Note however that GWFR $ does not prohibit grouping structures like
3.4, in which one subsidiary group of G¡ is further subdivided and the
other is not. Such situations are common; one occurs in example 3.1.
