of subgroups intervening between two levels of groups. This layer-
ing, though not stressed as such in chapters 6 and 7, is important for the
comparison with prosodic structure.

The well-formedness rules (section 7.2) make up the second sub-
component of the grammar of time-span reduction. They determine a set
of possible time-span reduction trees, such that every time-span has a
head selected out of the heads of the time-spans it immediately contains.
Third, the choice of head for each time-span is determined by the pref-
erence rules (sections 7.3 and 7.4), which are sensitive to metrical,
harmonic, voice-leading, and cadential properties of the events in the
time-span.

The version of hierarchical phonology most similar to the grammar of
time-span reduction is that developed by Selkirk (1978, 1980). More
than other approaches, Selkirk's makes clear the distinction between
rules of segmentation, rules that build tree structures on the basis of the
segmentation, and rules that determine relative prominence of sister
branches in the trees (though these distinctions are implicit in all the
other approaches). To bring out the parallelism with music, we will
present a version of Selkirk's theory, slightly modified from her presenta-
tion but preserving its essential insights.

Although the pioneering study by Liberman and Prince (1977) makes
use of the notions of syllable and foot, their formal role in the theory is
left somewhat unclear. Selkirk, however, argues that syllables and feet
must be explicitly marked as prosodic categories, and that these catego-
ries play a role in the formal statement of various phonological processes.
In addition, Selkirk argues for the existence of other, larger, prosodic
categories of word, phonological phrase, intonational phrase, and ut-
terance. The result is a segmentation of the phonological string into a
complex hierarchy that corresponds only in part to syntactic structure.
For example, 12.12 is the segmentation of the sentence In Pakistan, Tues-
day is a holiday. The levels to the left identify the prosodic categories.

An important way in which this structure is unlike syntactic structure
and like time-span segmentation is that, whereas in syntactic structure a
category may recur inside one of its constituents (for instance, NP inside
PP inside NP), this is impossible in the phonological segmentation.
