parts: when it plays isolated notes, they are usually strong beats; when it
plays sustained notes, they are much less likely to be syncopated than an
upper part is, and so forth. In other words, MPRs 3, 4, and 5 are given
extra weight when they apply to the bass. We express this tendency as
MPR 6; we have already alluded to its effects in the G Minor Symphony
above, where the bass attacks create extra metrical prominence.

MPR 6 (Bass) Prefer a metrically stable bass.*

The next rule concerns the behavior of the metrical preference rules at
cadences. It is generally the case in tonal music and in earlier idioms
within Western music that metrical disruptions such as syncopations and
cross-accents are extremely rare within cadences. In example 4.36 the
fourth measure of the Mozart A Major Sonata has been changed to show
what does not happen.

Of course, syncopations and cross-accents are common elsewhere, and
the approach to a cadence is not infrequently marked by a metrical
complexity such as a hemiola. An extreme case where the cadence is
practically the only point of metrical stability in the phrase is 4.37, mea-
sures 9-16 of the second movement of the Beethoven Sonata op. 110.

 

 

It seems fairly clear that cadences are an important factor in fixing metri-
cal as well as tonal structure. MPR 7 is a preliminary statement showing
the place of this aspect of metrical structure in the present theory.

MPR 7 (Cadence) Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which cadences
are metrically stable; that is, strongly avoid violations of local preference
rules within cadences.

Note that MPR 7 does not dictate whether a cadence should fall into a
metrical pattern of weak-strong (“masculine” cadence) or one of strong-
