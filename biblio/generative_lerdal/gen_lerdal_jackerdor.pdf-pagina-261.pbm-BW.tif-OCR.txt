at widely different reductional levels.? In measures 2-3 the line
Ct-D-E-F appears in the bass (bracketed in 10.7.) The Ct of this
line stems from the registrally isolated low C£ in measure 1. Only in
retrospect does one become aware that this low C itself initiates a large-
scale unfolding of the identical motive, so that its quick statement in
measures 2-3 seems like a surface foreshadowing. This larger statement
is indicated by the dashed arrows in the secondary notation in 10.7. At
level », the low Cf is finally answered in its own register by the D in
measure 21, with the large-scale arrival of the tonic. At this point the
pace of the motive quickens, the D proceeding to E and F at level e
(measures 21 and following). Surface motivic associations (the rising ar-
peggio in measures 1—2, 21—22, and so on) reinforce these connections.

Meanwhile, a version of the motive involving an augmented second
has appeared at level f (E—-F-G$—A in measures 7—13). This fragment is
then picked up, again at level f, in the lower register in the sequential
passage following measure 21. Finally, the combined pattern extends,
beyond the music shown in 10.7, by transposition (D-E—F-Gt-A to
A—-B-—C-—D$—E) to the E pedal beginning in measure 41. The different
rates at which this linear motive unfolds provide an important means for
unifying the disparate tempi of this movement.

The passage in 10.7 is instructive for another purpose as well: it is a
good example of a structural anacrusis (measures 1—20) resolving on a
structural downbeat (measure 21), as discussed in section 2.4. Note how
the downbeat of measure 21 represents the convergence of three separate
parameters: meter (a large-level beat), grouping (large-scale grouping
boundaries, in this case strengthened by an overlap), and time-span re-
duction (a large-scale harmonic arrival). Only where all three conditions
are met simultaneously do we speak of a structural downbeat. Note also
how the duration of the structural anacrusis, from measure 1 to the
downbeat of measure 21, is indicated by the grouping analysis and level b
of the reduction.

One feature of the reduction itself deserves special comment: the
choice of the opening V% as the head of the entire passage. One might
instead select the tonic chord in measure 3, on grounds of pitch stability
(TSRPR 2). This tonic, however, is heard within the context of a domi-
nant prolongation (see measures 1—6 at level f); in other words, TSRPR 6
overrrides TSRPR 2 here. Further supporting the V% are its low bass
register (TSRPR 3) andits position in the larger grouping structure as a
structural beginning (TSRPR 8). This latter factor also supports the choice
of the opening V* over the tonic arrival in measure 21; but the really
decisive factor in this case is parallelism (TSRPR 4), since any equivalent
to measure 21 is omitred in the recapitulation (in large part because its
motivic material is exhausted in the development section). (In order to
optimally fulfill normative structure (PRPR 6), the prolongational reduc-
tion would reverse the relative prominence of the V* in measure 1 and the
i in measure 21,)
