cadence, the dominant as well as the resolution to I or vi must be retained
in order for the reduction to make musical sense. The resulting two-event
sequence acts like a grammatical unit. To permit such a reduction to be
well formed, the condition for selecting the head of a time-span must be
enriched to allow a sequence of events forming a cadence to serve as the
head.

For convenience, we will call the last event of a cadence the final and
the element preceding it the penult. In a full cadence the penult is V and
the final is 1; in a deceptive cadence the penult is V and the final is vi ina
half cadence there is no penult and the final is V.5

Section 6.4 discussed various details of reductions involving cadences.
It suffices here to elaborate a few technical points. Example 7.14 illus-
trates the retention of the cadence in measures 7â€”8 of Mozart's K. 331.
The full cadence, labeled [c], is retained in reducing to the measure level.
