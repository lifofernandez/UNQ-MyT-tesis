relevant levels of the time-span reduction must also be invoked. Here
knowledge of the idiom is often required to decide what counts as or-
namentation and simplification. It appears that a set of preference rules
for parallelism must be developed, the most highly reinforced case of
which is identity. But we are not prepared to go beyond this, and we feel
that our failure to flesh out the notion of parallelism is a serious gap in
our attempt to formulate a fully explicit theory of musical understanding.
For the present we must rely on intuitive judgments to deal with this area
of analysis in which the theory cannot make predictions.

The problem of parallelism, however, is not at all specific to music
theory; it seems to be a special case of the much more general problem of
how people recognize similarities of any sort—for example similarities
among faces. This relation of the musical problem to the more general
problem of psychology has two consequences. On one hand, we may take
some comfort in the realization that our unsolved problem is really only
one aspect of a larger and more basic unsolved problem. On the other
hand, the hope of developing a solution to the musical problem in terms
of the preference-rule formalism suggests that such a formalism may be
more widely applicable in psychological theory.

Remarks on Formalism

Some readers may be puzzled by our assertion that grouping well-
formedness rules 1-5 and grouping preference rules 1-7 constitute a
formal theory of musical grouping. There are two respects in which our
theory does not conform to the stereotype of a formal theory. First, the
rules are couched in fairly ordinary English, not in a mathematical or
quasimathematical language. Second, even ¡f the rules were translated
into some sort of mathematical terms they would not be sufficient to
provide a foolproof algorithm for constructing a grouping analysis from
a given musical surface. This seems an appropriate place to defend our
theory against such possible criticisms.

The first criticism is rather easily disposed of. As we have said above,
our interest is in stating as precisely as possible the factors leading to
intuitive judgments. Mathematicization of the rules rather than precise
statement in English is useful only insofar as it enables us to make more
interesting or more precise predictions. Consider the grouping well-
formedness rules, which together define a class of hierarchical grouping
structures connected in a simple way to musical surfaces. One could
presumably translate these rules into the mathematical language of set
theory or network theory without difficulty. But no empirical content
would be added by such a translation, since there are no particularly
interesting theorems about sets or networks that bear on musical prob-
lems. In fact, the adoption of such a formalism would only clutter our
exposition with symbolic formulas that would obscure the argument.
Hence we have chosen to state our rules in ordinary English, but with
