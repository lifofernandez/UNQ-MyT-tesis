orientation was not psychological (as thar of generative linguistics 1s), but artistic;
the chief purpose of his theory was to illuminate structure 1n musical master-
pieces. Though our proposed theory also aspires to such illumination, its focus is
on musical cognition. Despite these differences, we are profoundly indebted to
Schenker's work—as, indeed, anybody in the field must be. Readers unfamiliar
with Schenker's work can find a good introduction in Forte 1959 or Jonas 1954.

2. See Kassler 1963, 1976 and Sundberg and Lindblom 1976 for studies along
these lines.

3. Smoliar 1980 and Snell 1979 are examples of such an approach.

4. Keiler (1975, 1978a), whose broad theoretical perspective seems to resemble
our own, makes this kind of transference of linguistic trees, replete with gram-
matical categories such as “tonic prolongation,” “ronic completion,” and “dom-
inant prolongation.” From our viewpoint, the resultant musical trees suffer from
the sort of superficial analogy between music and language for which he rightly
criricizes Bernstein (1976). One also wonders how in principle Keiler's proposed
theory will be able to generalize beyond classical tonal music. A musical grammar
must be conceived on a more abstract basis ¡f it 1s to be relevant to the funda-
mental issue of musical cognition.

Even in the restricred context of classical tonal music, there are severe short-
comings in the descriptive adequacy of Keiler's proposed trees (see for example
Keiler 1978a, pp. 212—221). We give three examples: (1) Keiler's trees cannor
assign structure to nonharmonic tones, thus missing obvious generalizations such
as the similar function of a passing chord and a passing tone. (2) Keiler's trees
cannor assign structure to such prevalent forms as an antecedent phrase or an
antecedent-consequent period, because his formalism requires every “tonic pro-
longarion” ro have a “tonic completion.” But it is precisely a characteristic of
“interruption” forms that at a certain point the tonic is not completed. (3)
Keiler's trees cannot assign strucrure to such common progressions as I -vi—[ and
IV-V-I, because the only categories available are “tonic” and “dominant.”
Plainly a “subdominant” category is needed. (The subdominant category would
also apply to the ii in a t15-V progression, dubiously analyzed by Keiler as
“dominant” to “tonic” under a “dominant prolongation.”)

Finally, we must distance ourselves from Keiler's generative approach in one
absolutely essential respect: Keiler does not develop, nor does he propose to
develop, a system of rules that pairs musical surfaces with heard musical struc-
rures. He has only developed an analytic notarion. Thus, despite the linguistic
ambience of his work and the “syntactic” nature of his trees, he is not engaged in
constructing a generative grammar in any sense normally intended by the term.
(See Jackendoff and Lerdahl 1980 for further discussion.)

5. However, such an assignment does occur in the musical surface in conjuncrion
with grouping overlap, where event x 1n 5.7c is represented twice in underlying
strucrure. The underlying tree has one branch to each occurrence of x and is
therefore well formed; hence x is assigned two distinct functions. See section 7.1.

6. The angles made by these branchings convey no informarion; they are simply a
fortuitous result of where an event is on the page in relation to the geometry of
the tree.

7. We discuss this already overdiscussed passage because, beneath its brevity and
apparent simplicity, it 1s unusually useful in presenting issues of general signifi-
cance. Reducrions of a wide variety of pieces will be presented in the following
chapters.
