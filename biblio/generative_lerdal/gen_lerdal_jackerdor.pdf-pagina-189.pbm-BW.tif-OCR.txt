beginning of the recapitulation is heard in the context of the opening, and
hence must be subordinate to it. Thus all large-scale strong prolongations
are right branches.

Next consider the insertion of an event between two superordinate
events. To take the general case, let y be an elaboration within the con-
text x...2 (8.9).

Schenkerian analysis does not necessarily specify y as an elaboration of
either x or z; often it suffices that y is inserted between x and z ata
subsequent level (8.9a). We, on the other hand, must specify either right
or left subordination for all cases (8.9b). If we can intuitively justify this
added formal requirement, prolongational reduction will have gained
another dimension of structural meaning.

To begin with, it should be understood that y is necessarily less conso-
nant (in the broadest sense of this term) than x or z; if it were not, x or 2
would be subordinate to it and hence could not already be attached in the
tree at more global levels. Therefore, whether y becomes a right branch
to x or a left branch to z, the pattern of tension and relaxation is thatofa
tensing from x to y and a relaxing from y to z (8.9c). This fact suggests
the following question: Does one experience y more as a tensing away
from x, or more as a relaxing toward 2? Alternatively: Is y more closely
related to x or to 2? These are at bottom the same question; it is a matter
of perceptual relatedness, of closeness of connection. If in a given case we
can distinguish the relative closeness of y to x andz, then we know which
branching to assign.

Let us consider some concrete examples. In monophony, intervallic
distance is a significant factor in determining the branching of an inter-
mediate subordinate event. In 8.10a the D connects more closely to (or
tenses more in relation to) the previous C, and thus connects as a right
branch; in 8.10b the F connects more closely (or relaxes more in relation
to) the following E, and thus connects as a left branch. Once harmony is
introduced, however, closeness is primarily a function of fundamental
bass analysis and distance in terms of the circle of fifths. Therefore the
intermediate event in 8.10cis a right branch and the intermediate event in
8.10d is a left branch. Finally, even though the branching decisions in
8.10a—8.10d are already fairly clear, intuition becomes still more definite
