We have tried to achieve a synthesis of the outlook and methodology of
contemporary linguistics with the insights of recent music theory. There
was a natural division of labor: Lerdahl, the composer, supplied musical
insights, and Jackendoff, the linguist, constructed formal systems to ex-
press them. But of course it was hardly that cut and dried. Lerdahl had
enough expertise in logic and linguistics to make substantial contribu-
tions on the formal side, and Jackendoff's experience as a performing
musician enriched the purely musical aspect of the enterprise. Con-
seguently, our individual contributions to the work are hopelessly in-
tertwined, and neither of us could really have done any part of the work
alone.

The result is a theory formulated in terms of rules of musical grammar.
Like the rules of linguistic theory, these are not meant to be prescriptions
telling the reader how one should hear pieces of music or how music may
be organized according to some abstract mathematical schema. Rather, it
is evident that a listener perceives music as more than a mere sequence of
notes with different pitches and durations; one hears music in organized
patterns. Each rule of musical grammar is intended to express a general-
ization about the organization that the listener attributes to the music he
hears. The grammar is formulated in such a way as to permit the descrip-
tion of divergent intuitions about the organization of a piece.

We do not expect that these organizing principles will necessarily be
accessible to introspection, any more than are the principles governing
the ability to speak, walk, or see. The justification of the rules, therefore,
lies not merely in whether they “look right” to ordinary intuition but in
their ability to describe intuitions about a wide range of musical passages.

We conceive of a rule of musical grammar as an empirically verifiable
or falsifiable description of some aspect of musical organization, poten-
tially to be tested against all available evidence from contrived examples,
from the existing literature of tonal music, or from laboratory experi-
ments. Time and again in the course of developing the theory we discov-
ered examples for which our musical intuitions did not conform to the
predictions of our then-current set of rules. In such instances we were
forced either to invent a new rule or, better, to come up with a more
general formulation of the rules we had. Our exposition of the grammar
here reflects some of this process of constant revision, but much more has
been expunged in the interest of sparing the reader many of our blind
alleys.

We consider this book a progress report in an ongoing program of
research, rather than a pristine whole. We have taken care to leave the
rough edges showing—to make clear where we have left problems un-
solved or where our solutions seem to us inadequate. We presentit at this
stage partly because of limitations of time and patience and partly out of
the realization that no theory ever reaches true completion. We feel,
