Example 7.14 represents the retention of a feminine cadence. In reduc-
ing to the dotted quarter-note level, the % at the beginning of measure 8 is
eliminated in favor of the V. Hence in the tree the $ is connected by an
ordinary branch to the V. In reducing to the measure level, because of the
metrical structure of a feminine cadence, the penult and the final occupy a
single time-span. Thus the cadence can be retained simply by refraining
from eliminating the penult. Finally, in the next step of reduction, the
head of measure 7 is subordinate to the entire cadence, so it is attached in
the tree to both elements of the cadence with a small “egg shape.”

The retention of a masculine cadence raises a slightly more difficult
problem. Example 7.15 shows some steps in reducing measures 5—6 of
“O Haupt.” Reduction to the half-note level proceeds as usual. At the
whole-note level, the head of measure 6 is obviously the D major chord
