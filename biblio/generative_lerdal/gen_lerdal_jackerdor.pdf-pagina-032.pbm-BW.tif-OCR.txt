Now consider the proposition that beats do not possess inherent
grouping. This means that a beat as such does not somehow belong more
to the previous beat or more to the following beat; for instance, in 4/4 the
fourth beat belongs no more to the third beat than to the following first
beat. In metrical structure, purely considered, a >eat does not “belong” at
all—rather, itis part of a pattern. A metrical pattern can begin anywhere
and end anywhere, like wallpaper.

But once metrical structure interacts with grouping structure, beats do
group one way or the other. If a weak beat groups with the following
stronger beat it is an upbeat; if a weak beat groups with the previous
stronger beat it is an afterbeat. In the Haydn minuet (2.12) the third beat
1s consistently heard as an upbeat because of the presence of a grouping
boundary before it, whereas in the scherzo of Beethoven's Second Sym-
phony (2.15) the third beat is consistently heard as an afterbeat because
of the presence of a grouping boundary after it. This difference between
the two passages is all the more salient because in other respects their
grouping and metrical structures are almost identical.?

 

Another example of how grouping and meter interact emerges ¡f we
consider a simple V—I progression. If it occurs at the beginning or in the
middle of a group it is not heard as a cadence, since a cadence by defini-
tion articulates the end of a group. If the progression occurs at the end of
