Neither of these is intuitively adequate, since they do not express the
structural importance of the tonic chord on the upbeat; they claim that at
this level the piece is heard as not beginning on a root-position tonic.
To capture the importance of the initial tonic, the anacrusis must be
included in some half-note level time-span. One solution is to posit,
before the upbeat, a hypothetical beat at the half-note level, within whose
time-span the anacrusis could be included. Example 7.5a shows the re-
sulting reduction; the hypothetical beat is enclosed in parentheses.

This is better than 7.4a or 7.4b, in that the importance of the initial tonic
is expressed. But in order to retain the tonic at the next step of reduction,
the whole-note level, we must posit a hypothetical beat at this level
tooâ€” three quarter-notes before the actual beginning of the piece, as in
7.5b. (In the third measure of 7.5b, the entire cadence is retained, follow-
ing the discussion in section 6.4.) The hypothetical beats in 7.5, unlike
the extra structure we have posited in grouping overlaps and elisions and
in metrical deletions, do not express any musical intuition; they are only
there to provide a time-span for the structurally important anacrusis to

occupy.

In the solution we have adopted, expressed in segmentation rule 2, the
upbeat belongs to an augmented time-span determined by the first beat at
the half-note level, as shown in 7.6a. Since the upbeatis structurally more
important than the other events in this time-span, the half-note-level
reduction is 7.6b.
