Here movements may differ or be ambiguous. Time-span segmentation
(PRPR 2) favors the right-branching reading; prolongational importance
(PRPR 4) favors left branching. However, a further consideration often
resolves the ambiguity. The half-cadential V at the end of the develop-
ment is usually heard within the diatonic pitch collection of the following
tonic, Whereas the V at the beginning of the development is heard within
the diatonic collection of the dominant key area. Hence, the half-caden-
tial V forms a stronger prolongational connection with the following I,
and attaches as a left branch.

Either of two common variants in sonata movements also favors the
left-branching reading, If the development ends with a full cadence that
overlaps with the recapitulation, the resolution of the full cadence is very
close in time-span segmentation to its V, overriding the connection to
the beginning of the development. Likewise, ¡f the development begins
(or the exposition ends) in an area other than V, the connection from
there to the cadential dominant is less stable, so the left-branching pro-
gression to I is again favored. Still, the structures of some developments
favor a right-branching ending, as shown by the dashed branch in 9.32.

Next we attach the structural boundaries of the exposition. The prob-
lem here is where the beginning of the second theme-group should at-
tach—as a progression away from the initial tonic (9.33a) or as an
anticipation of the end of the exposition (9.33b).

Intuition favors 9.33b, so that the second theme-group in itself exhibits
the basic form. For the rules to achieve this result, the conditions for
prolongational stability must favor connection through common diatonic
collection —even in the relatively unstable left-branching prolongation —
over departure to a new key,
