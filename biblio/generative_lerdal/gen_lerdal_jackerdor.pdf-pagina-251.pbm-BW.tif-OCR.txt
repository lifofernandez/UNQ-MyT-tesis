This refinement of the stability conditions is useful for other purposes
as well, so it is not an arbitrary decision restricted to this case alone. For
example, in a minuet whose trio is in a contrasting key, the trio intu-
itively forms its own independent patterns of tension and relaxation,
being heard as a unified insertion berween the minuet and the da capo. lf
we weight stability of prolongational connection strongly in favor of
maintaining diatonic collection, the desired result is obtained, as in 9.34.
