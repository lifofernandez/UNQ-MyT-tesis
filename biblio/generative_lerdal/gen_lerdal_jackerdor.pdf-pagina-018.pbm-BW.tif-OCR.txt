Whereas k never happens in music, j is at least conceivable, and ¿
occurs commonly (in the form of grouping overlaps and elisions). Thus
musical grouping is not strictly hierarchical in the sense just described.
However, the conditions under which overlaps and elisions are perceived
are highly constrained. These cases require special treatment. For now we
merely acknowledge their existence and notate them as at  where appro-
priate.? We will return to them in section 3.4.

Hierarchically correct grouping structures are illustrated in 2.3. The
beginning of the scherzo of Beethoven's Sonata op. 2, no. 2 (2.3a) shows
a typical, regular kind of grouping structure in classical music: a 4-bar
antecedent phrase is balanced by a 4-bar consequent phrase; both
phrases divide internally into 1+1+2 bars, and, at the next larger level,
into 2+2 bars. By contrast, the opening of Beethoven's Eighth Symphony
(2.3b) is an instance of a less symmetrical, more complex grouping
structure: although there are regular 4-bar groups at the smallest level
indicated, measures 5-12 group together (because of thematic paral-
lelism) at the next larger level to counterbalance measures 1—4, and to
produce at the still next larger level a 12-bar phrase. And there is a
legitimate, indeed prototypical case of grouping overlap at measure 12
in 2.3b: the event at the downbeat of measure 12 simultaneously ca-
dences one group (or set of groups) and begins another group (or set of
groups).

Two further general points about musical groups are already implicit
in this discussion of hierarchical organization. The first concerns the
relation among subordinate and dominating groups. This relation does
not differ from level to level or change in some substantive way at any
particular level, but is essentially the same at all levels of musical struc-
ture. For example, it never happens that one kind of overlap is allowed at
one level but disallowed at another. Or, to put the marter rather differ-
ently, any abstract grouping pattern could stand equally for local or
global levels of musical structure. Thus the abstract grouping in 2.1—
two groups enclosed within a larger one—occurs at three pairs of levels
in 2.3a: at the 1- and 2-bar levels at the beginning of each phrase
(1+1=2), at the 2- and 4-bar levels within each phrase (2+2=4), and at
the 4- and 8-bar levels within the passage as a whole (4+4=8). Because
