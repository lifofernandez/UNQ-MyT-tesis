hypotherical large-scale equal divisions to the local sense of metrical regularity is
bound to be conceptually difficult and arbitrary. (See the discussion of “ar-
chetvpes” in section 11.4.) Third, there is no a priorí reason why metrical struc-
ture should behave like pitch structure with regard to “background” structures. It
is topsy-turvy to develop an entire metrical theory from an assumprion —global
“metrical” divisions—so remote from the listener's actual experience of a piece
of music. A metrical theory should first of all be based on the immediate sensation
of strong and weak bears.

6. For example, Bruno Walter's performance (Columbia MS 6494) gives inter-
pretation A; Leonard Bernstein's (Columbia MS 7029) gives interpretation B.
Epstein (1978, pp. 68—70) develops a similar analysis of this passage in somewhat
different terms.

7. Bernstein (1976) artemprs such a model for this passage (with unconvincing
resulets, as he notes).

8. Contemporary theories of versification no longer rely on the crude caregories
of traditional prosody; see Halle and Keyser 1971 and Kiparsky 1977. We have
criticized Cooper and Meyer only in order to clarify theoretical issues. Their work
on rhythm is seminal.

9. There has been a tendency in some recent writing on rhythm (for example,
Komar 1971; Westergaard 1975) to downplay grouping in favor of meter, by
concentraring on the hierarchy of time-spans between bears and ignoring the
hierarchy of time-spans produced by grouping structure. Ir should therefore be
noted thar the elementary distinction just made berween upbear and afterbeat
would be theoretically inexpressible without the interaction of grouping and
merer.

10. A grear deal has been written abour this issue. For instance, Riemann (1903)
construes all groupings as end-accented; that is, as leading from an upbeat to a
downbeat (as in hypothesis B). Cooper and Meyer's asserrion of discontinuity
between hierarchical levels is an improvement: whereas local groupings may be
etther beginning-accented (trochaic, etc.) or end-accented (iambic. etc.). phrases
must be end-accented, because the cadence is the goal of the phrase. Thus they
end up with a version of hypothesis B (Cooper and Meyer 1960, p. 61). On the
other hand, writers as different as Tovey (1935) and Schenker (1935), by exten-
sion from the hierarchy of bears within a measure, have inclined in most cases
toward analyses of phrases as beginning-accented (hypothesis A). Cone 1968 (pp-
26—31) 1s the most persuasive proponent of hypothesis C— though he goes on to
accept the essentials of Cooper and Meyer's methodology, with all its arrendant
problems. Westergaard 1975 (pp. 309 ff,), despite an improved notartion and a
different terminology (his “first primary downbeat” corresponds to Cone's “ini-
tial downbeat,” his “second primary downbeat” to Cone's “cadential down-
beat”), also proposes a version of hypothesis C. Komar is caught berween a
commitment to the identification of structural accent with metrical accent (hy-
pothesis C) and a contrary commitment to equal metrical division, with a leaning
toward hypothesis B over hypothesis A. Because his system of metrical generation
does not otherwise allow for initial upbears (needed for hypothesis B), he is
forced, implausibly, to postulate a nonexistent metrically strong measure, which
then is erased by a subsequent operation (Komar 1971, p. 155). Morgan 1978
provides a cogent critique of some previous approaches, bur ends up ignoring
metrical accent and talking only abour structural accent. The most sensible dis-
cussion on this and related issues thar we have seen in print is Schachter 1976.
