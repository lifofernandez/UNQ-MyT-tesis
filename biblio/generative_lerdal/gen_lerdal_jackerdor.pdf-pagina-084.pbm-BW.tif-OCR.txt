Next consider example 4.22, which differs from 4.16a only in that the
second eighth note in each group has been lengthened into a quarter note.

Intuitions about 4,22 are interestingly different from those about 4.16a.
Here structure ¿ is considerably more natural than structure ¿¿ (unless the
eighth is stressed, invoking MPR 4), and both are far preferable to struc-
ture úii, Similarly, in 4.23 the quarter note attracts the strong beat on
both the quarter-note level (since structure ¿ is more natural than struc-
ture 7í) and the half-note level (since structure ii is slightly more natural
than structure i). Notice how these examples differ in preferred struc-
ture from 4.16b and 4,17a, which have the same attack pattern but lack
the long note.

These examples suggest a fifth metrical preference rule,

MPR $ (Length), first version Prefer a metrical structure in which rela-
tively strong beats occur at the inception of notes of relatively long
duration.

According to this rule, the quarter notes in 4.14b, 4.22, and 4.23 receive
an extra preference-rule marking, which the eighth notes followed by
rests in 4.14a, 4.16a, and 4.16b lack. Thus the presence of quarter notes
creates exactly the observed biases in metrical structure,

This is only a first approximation to a far more interesting rule. The
notion of length appears to generalize to a number of phenomena other
than simply how long a particular pitch-event is sustained. For example,
the alternation of forte and piano in 4.24 creates a preferred metrical
structure in which strong beats occur on the changes. (In addition, the
