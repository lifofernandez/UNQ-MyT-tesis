10.3

Some Time-Span
and Prolongational
Reductions

258

Each of the following prolongational reductions will be preceded by the
time-span reduction (along with the associated grouping and metrical
analyses) from which it is derived. We begin with the opening portion of
Mozart's G Minor Symphony, as a reductional addendum to the detailed
rhythmic analyses in chapters 2-4. Then we analyze Bach's C Major
Prelude from volume I of The Well-Tempered Clavier and Schubert's
“Morgengruss” from the song cycle Die Schone Múllerin; in both of
these cases, issues of general interest arise. Finally, we consider a complex
development section, from Mozart's D Major Quintet K. 593.3

In example 10.8 (a simplified version of the first 22 bars of the
G Minor Symphony), the metrical analysis duplicates that of “hypothesis
A” discussed in section 2.2. The grouping analysis is complicated and
depends in part on reductional considerations (GPR 7); for example, it
would seem reductionally inappropriate to connect the introductory bar
(measure 1) at a larger grouping level than that in 10.8. The most difficult
grouping decision concerns measures 14-16: should the subsidiary
woodwind line receive a separate group, or should we maintain the prin-
ciple of nonpolyphonic grouping analyses? We have chosen the latter
course, with the result that measures 12-—16 are analyzed simply as an
extended answer (GPR 6) to measures 10—11. Here, and also in measure
1, subgroup bracketing fills the time-span breach where the grouping
analysis fails to segment the musical surface beyond a certain level of
detail.

In cases where the grouping analysis is so irregular, the assignment of
levels in the time-span reduction becomes somewhat arbitrary. We have
therefore taken the added step in 10.8 of labeling the groups according to

their corresponding reductional levels; in-between grouping levels are

given primed letters. (The subgroup bracketings in measures 1 and 16
receive the label e because they would have extended through that time-
span—the 2-bar level—if they had not been “cut off” by grouping
boundaries.)

The secondary notation in 10.8 also requires an adjustment. Normally
we notate events over the duration of their relevant group. But this
becomes cumbersome when grouping and meter are as out of phase as
they are here. Hence we have opted to notate the durations not according
to grouping structure but according to metrical periodicity; the second-
ary notation thereby becomes easier to read and hear. The tree is not
affected by this change. At the same time, however, it becomes more
difficult to correlate the tree with the secondary notation; so we have
added grouping markings within the secondary notation itself to show
which events are available for analysis at any given stage. For example,
the groups marked e beneath level f in the secondary notation indicate
the selectional possibilities for level e.

The prolongational reduction shown in 10.9 follows without compli-
cation from 10.8—thatiis, the prolongational reduction preference rules
