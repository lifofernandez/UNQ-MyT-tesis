The Interaction
Principle

227

So far we have presented only one example in which PRPR 3 contributes
to the choice of e,: the antecedent-consequent pattern in 9.8 and 9.9. In
this example, PRPR 1 does not provide any preference between the inter-
mediate V and I, so PRPR 3 alone decides between them. However, this
example was chosen specifically to isolate the effects of PRPR 3. When we
turn to more complex cases, the two rules interact profusely. Their inter-
action is central to our theory of prolongational reduction.

The Mozart K. 331 theme provides an especially good illustration of
the interaction of PRPRs 1 and 3. Example 9.11 presents the time-span
reduction for a harmonic sketch of the first four measures; for simplicity,
let us assume that level e is the musical surface.

In forming the prolongational reduction, let us assume that we have
already attached the initial Tand the cadential V to form a prolongational
region, as in 9.12. This is the antecedent portion of the tree derived in
92.9b.
