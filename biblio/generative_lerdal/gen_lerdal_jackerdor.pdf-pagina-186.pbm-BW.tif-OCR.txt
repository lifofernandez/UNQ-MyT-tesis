8.5 (cont.)

 

Second, a joining of branches by a filled-in circle (8.5b) signifies what we
call a weak prolongation: the roots of the two events are identical, but
one of the events is in a less consonant position, either with respect to the
bass (chordal inversion) or— secondarily—with respect to the melodic
note. Third, a joining of branches by an open circle (8.5c) signifies what
we call a strong prolongation: the roots, bass notes, and melodic notes of
the two events are identical. Here pitch factors alone produce no increase
or decrease in tension, so rhythmic factors must be invoked to decide
right or left branching. We will take up this issue in the next section.
The different kinds of right and left branching do not represent the
same degrees of tension or relaxation. Consider right branching first. A
repetition of the same event is intrinsically nontensing (8.6a). A repeti-
tion in a less consonant form induces some degree of tension (8.6b). Most
tensing is a progression to a completely different and less consonant event

(8.60).

In left branching the pattern is reversed, because left branching signifies a
movement toward relaxation. The least relaxing connection is an antici-
pation of the same event (8.6d), since no change in pitch structure takes
