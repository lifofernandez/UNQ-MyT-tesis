What really influences the metrical structure is the stability of the bass
within the harmonic context: the lower bass is favored, but not at the
expense of choosing an inversion (especially a 5 chord) over root position.
These principles of bass stability play a role in determining the time-span
reduction, and it would miss a generalization to repeat them in the metri-
cal rules, Rather, the appropriate account seems to be a metrical prefer-
ence rule that takes into account the interaction with the time-span
reduction.

The preference rules for time-span reduction are concerned with the
relative structural importance of events (see chapters 6 and 7). Broadly
speaking, the factors involved are pitch stability, metrical stability, and
articulation of groups. It often happens that pitch considerations and
metrical considerations are at odds, for example in a suspension. In such
a case the choice of time-span reduction is conflicted, with the result that
the reduction is less stable at that point than it would be if all the factors
were reinforcing.

Now consider the G Minor Symphony. If the higher bass note were
chosen as the strong beat at the whole-note level, the rules of time-span
reduction would encounter a conflict between metrical and pitch consid-
erations, since the more stable pitch-event (the low G) would fall in the
weaker metrical position. On the other hand, if the low G is chosen as the
strong beat, metrical and pitch considerations reinforce each other, re-
sulting in a more stable time-span reduction. Similarly, in 4.39 the C in
the bass is far more stable than the G in terms of pitch, since it forms a
root-position chord and the G forms a %; hence the least conflicted time-
span reduction results from a metrical analysis with the C on a stronger
beat. These considerations suggest the following preference rule:

mizes conflict in the time-span reduction.7

A More Difficult Example

Example 4.40 is the opening of the finale of the Haydn Quartet op. 76,
no. 6. The smallest metrical level is of course supplied by the metrical
well-formedness rules; we will show how the next two levels are derived
by the metrical preference rules. As usual, the example is presented with-
out bars and beams. The dashed vertical lines are added as a visual aid.

The first half of the passage is characterized by tremendous metrical
ambiguity. The reader is invited to demonstrate to himself how many
