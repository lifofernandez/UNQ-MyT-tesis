Formalization of Prolongational Reduction

In the discussion in chapter 8 of the essential intuitions behind prolonga-
tional reduction, we assumed that the Strong Reduction Hypothesis ap-
plies to this domain of musical analysis, that is, that it makes sense to
describe these intuitions in the form of a unified tree structure. Now we
state this assumprion overtly:

Prolongational Hypothesis 1 Intuitions about pitch-derived tension and

relaxation in a piece can be expressed in terms of a strictly hierarchical

segmentation of the piece into prolongational regions, such that

a. each region represents an overall tensing or relaxing in the progression
from its beginning to its end, and

b. tensings and relaxings internal to each region represent subordinate
and nonoverlapping stages in the overall progression.

In our initial discussion of tension and relaxation in section 8.1 we
implicitly assumed Prolongational Hypothesis 1, in that we drew dia-
grams like 9.1a and 9.1b (copies of 8.3a and 8.3b) but none that were
like 9.1c and 9.1d.

All of the examples in 9.1 satisfy condition a of Prolongational Hypothe-
sis 1, since each arrow represents an overall tensing or relaxing from its
beginning to its end. In 9.1a and 9.1b the regions form a hierarchical
structure of the usual sort, whereas 9.1c and 9.1d violate condition b in
that they contain overlapping of the sort we have disallowed in other
components of musical structure. Prolongational Hypothesis 1 claims
that such situations do not occur in musical intuition. Where they seem to
occur, it is as a result of structural ambiguity in a piece—two indepen-
dently viable structures in competition—not as part of a single unified
structure. It is this property that permits prolongational reductions to be
represented as tree structures.
