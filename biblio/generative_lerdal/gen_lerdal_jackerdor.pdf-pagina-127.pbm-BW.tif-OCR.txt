important events. Whereas in time-span reduction this relationship con-
cerns relative stability within rhythmic units, in prolongational reduction
it concerns relative stability expressed in terms of continuity and progres-
sion, the movement toward tension or relaxation, and the degree of
closure or nonclosure. The prolongational component not only expresses
intuitions of connection and continuity such as those suggested in 5.13
and 5.14, but also provides “psychological” interpretations for them in
precise structural terms, by means of a tree notation to be described in
section 8.1,

In order to define the notion of prolongational importance, we again
need more than purely pitch criteria, so that incorrect reductions such as
5.10 may be avoided. We will show in chapters 8 and 9 that prolonga-
tional importance is derived not from the musical surface, but from the
associated time-span reduction, with all its encoded rhythmic structure.
Thus, indirectly, grouping and meter are also implicated in prolonga-
tional structure. The inclusiveness of this hypothesis mirrors the intuitive
judgment that patterns of tension and relaxation are at the heart of
musical understanding.

The two kinds of reduction interact in a fashion not unlike the in-phase
or out-of-phase relationship between grouping and meter. If the domains
produced by the two reductions correspond, the reductions can be said to
be congruent; if not, they are noncongruent. As with the “phase” re-
lationship, congruence and noncongruence are relative terms. A good
example of an acutely noncongruent passage is the K. 331 phrase, since
at a certain prolongational level the region of the opening tonic extends
to the downbeat of measure 4 (as shown in 5.14), in contrast with the
pitch hierarchy heard through the time-span segmentation in 5.12. If the
prolongationally significant events were evenly distributed across the
time-spans— say, if the I in measure 4 had arrived on the downbeat of
measure 3—the phrase would be fairly congruent. As it is, the opening
tonic seems to stretch like a rubber band, which in measure 4 belatedly
springs loose. In general the interaction of the two kinds of reduction has
a great deal to do with the “shape” of a passage. Congruent passages
seem relatively straightforward and square; noncongruent passages have
a more complex, elastic quality,

We will now devote two chapters in turn to each kind of reduction.
