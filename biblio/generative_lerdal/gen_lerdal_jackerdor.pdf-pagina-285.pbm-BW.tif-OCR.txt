Musical Innateness

form of the grammar; 3a is represented by the absence of well-formed-
ness rules linking grouping and meter; 3b is a generalized statement of
the time-span segmentation rules; 3c concerns certain aspects of time-
span reduction preference rules; 3d concerns aspects of the prolon-
gational reduction preference rules; 4 states a presupposition of the
preference rules for both reductions; $ is represented rather directly by
TSRPRs 7 and $ and indirectly by PRPR 6 (normative structure).

One might wonder why we are so concerned with universals of musical
grammar, particularly in the sense of “universal” defined at the beginning
of this section. The reason is that universals of this sort are crucial to the
question of the innateness of musical cognitive capacity, a topic to which
we now turn.

In outlining our goals for music theory in chapter 1, we distinguished two
sorts of inquiry. The first was to describe the experienced listener's
knowledge of a musical idiom by means of a musical grammar for the
idiom; the second was to explicate the source of this knowledge. We
argued there that, to the degree that the listener's knowledge is complex
and abstract with respect to the musical surface, it becomes more difficult
to explain his acquisition of this knowledge on the basis of simple gener-
alization over presented musical surfaces (the “stimulus generalization”
of empiricist psychology).

Having developed a grammar of tonal music in considerable detail, we
are now in a position to make the argument more pointed. If the rules
we have proposed correspond at all closely to principles unconsciously
known and used by the experienced listener, one must ask how the
listener manages to learn them. And of all the possible organizations one
could attribute to tonal music (including all the incorrect ones posited by
us music theorists), why does the listener infer the ones he does? The only
answer that we find defensible is that one does not have to learn the entire
grammar from scratch. Rather, one has no choice about much of it; many
aspects of the grammar are simply the only (or easiest) ways that one's
mental abilities make available for organizing a musical signal.? In other
words, much of the complexity of musical intuition is not learned, but is
given by the inherent organization of the mind, itself determined by the
human genetic inheritance.

In trying to separate those aspects of musical intuition that are innately
given from those that are learned, we have two independent sources of
evidence. First, as just argued, it would appear implausible that someone
could construct the entire grammar solely on the basis of presented mu-
sical surfaces. In particular, those parts of the grammar that are especially
remote from the surface evidence are strong candidates for innateness. It
is unlikely, for instance, that one could infer from a number of un-
analyzed musical surfaces even the existence of a prolongational compo-
