31 separate pieces? It is because the listener relates them, more or less
unconsciously in the process of listening, to an abstract, simplified struc-
ture common to them all.

Such relationships are needed not just for the analysis of written-out
music. In any musical tradition that involves improvisation on a given
subject (such as jazz or raga), the performer must actively employ knowil-
edge of principles of ornamentation and variation to produce a coherent
improvisation.

In all these cases, the listener or performer has an intuitive under-
standing of the relative structural importance of pitches. If a pitch is
heard as ornamenting another pitch, it is felt as structurally less impor-
tant than the other pitch—it is subordinate to the other pitch. In short,
the pitch relations involved in these intuitions are hierarchical.

Music theorists have of course been aware of these principles for hun-
dreds of years. But it was especially the insight of the early twentieth
century theorist Heinrich Schenker that the organization of an entire
piece can be conceived of in terms of such principles, and that such
organization provides explanations for many of the deeper and more
abstract properties of tonal music. For present purposes, this insight
might be phrased as follows:

Reduction Hypothesis The listener attempts to organize all the pitch-
events of a piece into a single coherent structure, such that they are heard
in a hierarchy of relative importance.

This hypothesis is central to Schenkerian analysis andits derivatives. (Itis
emphatically not a claim of “implication-realization” theories, like that
of Narmour 1977.) A consequence of the claimis that part of the analysis
of a piece is a step-by-step simplification or reduction of the piece, where
at each step less important events are omitted, leaving the structurally
more important events as a sort of skeleton of the piece. In Schenkerian
theory, the steps closest to the musical surface are called “foreground,”
and successive steps lead in turn to “middleground” and “background”
levels.

Within our theory we have found it desirable to tighten the Reduction
Hypothesis by adding the following conditions:

a. Pitch-events are heard in a strict hierarchy (in the sense described in
section 2.1).

b. Structurally less important events are not heard simply as insertions,
but in a specified relationship to surrounding more important events.

We will use the term Strong Reduction Hypotbhesis to refer to this tighter
version of reduction. Not all notions of reduction in the literature share
these conditions.

The Strong Reduction Hypothesis leaves three areas of freedom in
fleshing out what constitutes a proper reduction of a piece: (1) what the
