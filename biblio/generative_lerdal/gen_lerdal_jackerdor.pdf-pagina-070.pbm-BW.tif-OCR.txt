On the other hand, transition 7—8 has the strongest application of GPR 2
in the passage, because of its rest and the preceding long note; thus GPR 4
(intensification) favors grouping 3.36b, in which this transition is the
most important grouping boundary. Moreover, the strongest motivic
parallelism in the passage obtains berween events 1-4 and 8-11; since
the rule of parallelism prefers these to be parallel parts of groups, this rule
too favors grouping 3.36b. (If, in addition, purely binary grouping is
desired in 3.36b, to minimally satisfy the symmetry rule, the relatively
strong motivic parallelism berween 8—10 and 14-—16 favors an additional
group, including events 14-27, as shown in 3.36c.)

The choice between 3.36a and 3.36b is the first point where the prefer-
ence rules result in an ambiguous grouping in this passage. We personally
incline toward 3.36b, treating the second large group in effect as an
extended repetition of the first group. The resulting asymmetry is char-
acteristic of the piece*s style, in which symmetry is deliberately avoided so
as to thwart the possibility of maximal reinforcement of preference rules.
That is, the difference between this style and Mozart's with respect to
grouping is not in its grammar as such, but in what structures the com-
poser chooses to build using the grammar.

In the Mozart and Stravinsky passages we have examined, the group-
ing preference rules have encountered at least minor conflicts. Consider
what an example would look like in which the preference rules encoun-
tered no conflicts and strongly reinforced each other at all points. Such an
example would have strongly marked group boundaries; the major group
boundaries would be more strongly marked than the minor ones; and the
piece would be totally symmetrical, would have only binary subdivisions
of groups, and would display considerable parallelism among groups.
The theory predicts that the grouping of such a passage would be totally
obvious. Example 3.37, part of the anonymous fifteenth-century French
instrumental piece Dit le Bourguignon, is just such a case. As usual, ap-
plications of GPRs 2 and 3 are marked at relevant transitions.
