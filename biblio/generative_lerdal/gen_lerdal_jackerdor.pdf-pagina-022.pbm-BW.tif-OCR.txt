are strongly contradictory yet not strong enough, or regular enough, to
override the inferred pattern. In sum, the listener's cognitive task is to
match the given pattern of phenomenal accentuation as closely as possi-
ble to a permissible pattern of metrical accentuation; where the two
patterns diverge, the result is syncopation, ambiguity, or some other kind
of rhythmic complexity.

Metrical accent, then, is a mental construct, inferred from but not
identical to the patterns of accentuation at the musical surface. Our
concern now is to characterize this construct. However, because “metri-
cal accent” is nothing but a relative term applied to beats within a regular
metrical hierarchy, we can instead describe what constitutes a metrical
pattern. Specifically, we need to investigate the notions of “beat,” “peri-
odicity,” and “metrical hierarchy.” In the course of this discussion we
will develop an analytic notation for metrical structure and outline the
range of permissible metrical patterns.

Before proceeding, we should note that the principles of grouping
structure are more universal than those of metrical structure. In fact,
though all music groups into units of various kinds, some music does not
have metrical structure at all, in the specific sense that the listener is
unable to extrapolate from the musical signal a hierarchy of beats. Ex-
amples that come immediately to mind are Gregorian chant, the alap
(opening section) of a North Indian raga, and much contemporary music
(regardless of whether the notation is “spatial” or conventional). At the
opposite extreme, the music of many cultures has a more complicated
metrical organization than that of tonal music. As will emerge, the
rhythmic complexities of tonal music arise from the interaction of a
comparatively simple metrical organization with grouping structure, and,
above all, from the interaction of both components with a very rich pitch
structure.

The Metrical Hierarchy
The elements that make up a metrical pattern are beats. It must be
emphasized at the outset that beats, as such, do not have duration.
Players respond to a hypothetically infinitesimal point in the conductor's
beat; a metronome gives clicks, not sustained sounds. Beats are idealiza-
tions, utilized by the performer and inferred by the listener from the
musical signal. To use a spatial analogy: beats correspond to geometric
points rather than to the lines drawn between them. But, of course, beats
occur in time; therefore an interval of time—a duration—takes place
between successive beats. For such intervals we use the term time-span.
In the spatial analogy, time-spans correspond to the spaces between geo-
metric points. Time-spans have duration, then, and beats do not.3
Because beats are analogous to points, it is convenient to represent
them by dots. The sequences of dots in 2.6 stand for sequences of beats.
