the events within it: fusion, in which the head represents the simultane-
ous sounding of two or more events from the time-span; transformation,
in which the head is a composite of the events in the time-span; and
cadential retention, in which two successive events forming a cadence are
both retained. Prosodic theory has no equivalent for these three addi-
tional relationships. Thus, if it were desirable to adopt a uniform nota-
tion for the two theories, time-span notation would be more appropriate;
phonological theory would merely adopt the restrictive form with only
ordinary branching. On the other hand, Morris Halle has informed us
(personal communication) that recent developments suggest the possibil-
ity of other relationships in phonology not shared by music. In other
words, phonology and music might share a common core of hierarchical
structure but diverge in various specifics.

A second formal difference between the two theories concerns the
plurality of branching. In time-span theory, most of the branching we
have discussed has been binary; each time-span above the smallest level
contains two time-spans of the next smaller level. However, in a triple
meter (such as the 6/8 of Mozart K. 331), ternary branching appears at a
certain subgroup level. Itis also not inconceivable for a group to contain
three or more smaller groups: for example, in strophic songs and varia-
tion forms, the largest segmentation of the piece is often into as many
groups as there are verses or variations.

On the other hand, prosodic theory has been formulated in terms of
strictly binary branching. Where a foot, for example, contains more than
two syllables, the segmentation and the resulting tree are constructed
using recursive binary branching, as in 12.22a, rather than multiple
branching, as in 12.22b. Is this a real difference berween language and
Music, oris it just a consequence of the way the two theories happen to be
stated?
