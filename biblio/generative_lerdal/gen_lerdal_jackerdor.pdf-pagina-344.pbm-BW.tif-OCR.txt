4. Some additional examples of transformation appear in the analysis of the
Schumann song “Wehmur” in Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977.

5. One might wonder whether optional chords of dominant preparation might be
retained in a time-span reduction along with rhe obligatory penult and final of full
and deceptive cadences or with the obligatory V of half cadences. We have found
that retention of the dominant preparation adds little to a time-span reduction's
ability to convey the sense of a phrase. The importance of dominant preparation
will be reflected in prolongational reduction. See sections 8.3 and 9.4.

6. This rule differs from TSRPR 1, which considers only the metrical structure
within one time-span at a time. This rule considers the overall relation of a
reductional level to metrical structure, a more global consideration.

7. On the other hand, occasions arise in which the cadential resolution 1s not at
the very end of a group, but is prolonged to the end of the group. This occurs, for
instance, at the end of the Chorale St. Antoni, discussed in section 8.5; the
functional final cadence occurs in measures 22—23, and the final tonic is pro-
longed through two V7/IV—-IV—_[ sequences to the end in measure 29. A much
more extreme situation arises in the finale of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, where
the structural cadence for the entire movement occurs long before the end; the
rest is a prolongation of the resolution. These exceptions are due to the influence
of prolongational reduction. See section 9.6 for discussion.

1. The following account of prolongational reduction differs from that in Lerdahl
and Jackendoff 1977. We feel that the present version is a major improvement,
but even so it remains less finished rhan the other three components. In section
10.4 we outline two possible furure developments in prolongational reduction.

2. Various writers have found patterns of tension and relaxation to be funda-
mental to the nature of rhythm. For example, Sessions (1951, p. 84): “The
principle of tension and relaxation is perhaps the most important single principle
of musical rhythm, and its bearing on all questions of musical expression cannot
be overestimated.” Also see Schachter 1976 (pp. 333—334). For a much different
approach to tension and relaxation, see Hindemith's theory of “harmonic fluctu-
ation” (1942, pp. 115—121).

3. We originally adopted this formulation (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977, p. 140).

4. Rhyrhmic factors might instead lead to a different analysis of 8.22, in which
the Vhi would be embedded within a weak prolongation of i.

$. The reduction in 8.39 agrees in essentials with Schenker's analysis of the piece
(1935, figures 42,2 and 138,3). Our main disagreements— intuitive as well as
technical — concern Schenker's elevation of the V in measure 11 (the bass) to the
level of the Ursatz and his treatment of the melodic Eb in measure 15 as super-
ordinarte within its local environment (he makes it a neighboring motion at the
background). In both cases Schenker radically separates bass and melodic func-
tions; we discuss this matter in section 10.4.

1. In the course of numerous analyses we have encountered only one or two cases
where one might conceivably want to choose an event 10 time-span levels down.
Without more serious examination of a number of such cases, it is hard to
determine whar motivates this extremely rare weakening of the Interacrion
Principle.
