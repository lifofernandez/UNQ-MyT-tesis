grouping and meter. In other words, it takes a great deal to override
MPR 1,

In this section we illustrate some ways in which time-span reduction can
be useful in illuminating motivic relationships.

First consider the rondo theme from Beethoven's Pathétique Sonata,
op. 13. As indicated by the dashed circles in 10.3, the phrase begins and
ends with almost identical motivic material at the musical surface, Yet
this obvious relationship is partially obscured because the main notes of
the motive assume, respectively, virtually opposite reductional functions:
the Eb on the downbeat of measure 1 is the structural beginning of the
phrase, whereas the corresponding E in measure 7 is only part of an
embellishing cadential 4; the D in measure 1 is a passing tone, whereas
the corresponding D in measure 7 is part of the cadence for the entire
phrase; the C on the downbeat of measure 3 is only part of an unfolding
of the opening tonic chord, whereas the corresponding C in measure 8
resolves the whole passage. In the tree of 10.3, parallel treatment of
parallel passages (time-span reduction preference rule 4) must give way
to the more global factors of the structural beginning and cadence
(TSRPRs 7 and8). This conflict berween surface similitude and underlying
function gives the theme much of its particular character,.

The opposite case—where reductionally parallel relationships reveal
underlying motivic connections not readily apparent at the musical sur-
face—is much more common in music of the Classical period (though
notin that of the late nineteenth century). By way of illustration, consider
the opening of the minuet of Beethoven's Sonata, op. 22 (example 10.4).
