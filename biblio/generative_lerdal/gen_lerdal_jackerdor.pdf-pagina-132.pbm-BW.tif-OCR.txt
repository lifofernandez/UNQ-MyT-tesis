Time-Span Trees
and Metrical
Structure

128

Many passages are simply heard as irregular; in such cases it would be
sheer speculation to choose one “regularized” version over another. A
reliance on grouping structure, on the other hand, poses no such theoret-
ical difficulties, because there is no requirement that groups be periodic.1

To sum up: At the smallest levels, metrical structure is the only
influence on the choice of time-spans, and the time-spans are regular in
length. At some intermediate level, grouping boundaries may interrupt
the regularity imposed by the metrical pattern, and the time-spans result
from the interaction of meter and grouping. At still larger levels, the
time-spans are totally determined by grouping structure, and metrical
structure is irrelevant.

Now let us begin to construct trees for sequences of pitch-events as they
occur within the time-span segmentation. Figure 6.6 schematizes the gen-
eral case: if events x and y are the most important events in time-spans a
and b respectively, and if at the next larger level they are contained in
time-span c, then either x dominates y (a right branch) (6.6a) or y domi-
nates x (a left branch) (6.6b). This process continues recursively through
the time-span segmentation until one event dominates the time-span of
the entire piece.

Sometimes the time-span segmentation includes three spans within the
next larger span. This happens most frequently at local levels of pieces in
triple meter, but can also occur at large levels if phrases or sections group
together in threes. Such segmentation causes ternary branching when
