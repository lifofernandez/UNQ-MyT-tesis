A cadential preparation and a cadence together often produce a de-
scending circle-of-fifths progression in terms of fundamental bass
motion. Think of the typical i15-V-—1 cadential formula; this naturally
receives an embedded left-branching structure (as in 8.18b). But not all
cadential preparations relate to the V by fifth motion — for example, the
IV in the equally typical IV-V-—I progression. Yet the ii and the IV
function similarly in these progressions; the difference between the two
lies in details of melodic voice leading, not in the harmony, where the
essential fact in both is the bass motion from the fourth to the fifth scale
degree.

Clearly a generalization about cadential preparations is needed that
includes both of these possibilities for cadential preparation and others as
well. Traditional harmonic theory is relevant here, with its generalized
conception of “subdominant function,” some realizations of which are
listed in figure 8.19. In all these cases, the chief sense of the “sub-
dominant”-to-dominant progression is one of the “subdominant” lead-
ing and relaxing into the dominant. Therefore any “subdominant” must
attach as a left branch to the following cadential dominant. And because
the cadential V—I is also a left branch, the overall progression of “sub-
dominant” to dominant to tonic must always take the form of a doubly
embedded left-branching progression (8.19). This conclusion seems only
proper, since a doubly embedded left-branching progression signifies the
maximal decrease in tension among three adjacent events—just as one
would expect at the end of a phrase.

Variants on the configuration in 8.19 can weaken or strengthen the
cadence. For example, cadences without cadential preparation are com-
paratively weak (8.20a); cadences with triply embedded left branching
tend to be very strong (8.20b,c). The cadential % increases the sense of
resolution by adding, at a lower level (since it is a locally dissonant
elaboration), a second left branch to the dominant (8.20d). Sometimes, as
compensation, a suspension functionally replaces an absent sub-
dominant preparation (8.20e) (see the cadential patterns in the Bach
chorale “O Haupt” in section 6.6).
