6.12

phrase of the entire chorale, a suspension occurs at the equivalent place at
that particular time-span level. Thus the one pitch-meter irregularity in
the opening phrases yields a greater global regularity.)

Example 6.12 compresses the information conveyed in 6.9-6.11. This
is our normal format for time-span reduction.

 

Here the letters labeling branchings signify not pitch-meter relationships
(we assume acquaintance with these from now on), but reductional
levels. Specifically, in the tree and at the left in the secondary notation, c
stands for the eighth-note level, b for the quarter-note level, and a for the
half-note level of this example. Beneath the actual music and above the
secondary notation appear the grouping and metrical analyses. We omit
the subgroup bracketing (with which we also henceforth assume ac-
quaintance) because it does not constitute a separate component in the
sense that grouping, meter, and the two kinds of reduction do.

To carry the reduction of the chorale farther than level a in 6.12, we
must first develop the treatment of cadencesâ€”rhe subject of section 6.4.
A complete reduction will be presented in section 6.6.
