“event,” in both its harmonic and melodic aspects, assumes a unique
position in the overall hierarchy. In our theory harmonic criteria have
generally (though not always) overridden melodic criteria when the two
have been in conflict, because melodic features are for the most part
heard within a harmonic context. But even if this approach succeeds in a
wide variety of cases, it is a simplification of musical reality.

Consider, for example, the progression shown in 10.20.

Obviously the melody depends on the harmonic context: the sequence
E—D-C is heard in C major (rather than, say, E minor or F major, in
which it would receive differing reductional functions); the D is heard as
passing between (and hence subordinate to) notes of the tonic triad. Our
standard prolongational analysis appears in 10.20a. But the melody
and the harmony are also heard somewhat differently. As illustrated in
10.20b, the melodic D in the V chordis a prolongational repetition of the
D in the 1i%, and the final Lis a prolongational repetition of the initial I.
(Here the reader must get accustomed to reading trees upside-down.)
Thus, ¡f separate but related trees are assigned to the melody and the
harmony, each tree in 10.20b differs from the tree in 10.20a.
Especially significant in 10.20b are the implications of the largest levels
of branching. Most tonal pieces progress from the tonic to a more stable
tonic; this is represented in 10.20a and in the melodic analysis in 10.20b.
But in another sense most pieces are prolongational extensions of the
initial tonic; this is represented in the harmonic analysis in 10.20b.

Consider also a typical deceptive cadence, V-vi or V-—vi. Here the mel-
ody resolves to the tonic while the harmony tenses away from the tonic.
In such cases, our single tree analysis has emphasized the motion toward
