The need to prevent such situations is one of the motivations for group-
ing well-formedness rule 5 (“If a group G contains a smaller group G»,
G1 must be exhaustively partitioned into smaller groups”).

Though we will encounter no grouping overlaps until near the end of
this chapter, their effect on time-span segmentation is best described here.
Essentially, we want to say that an overlapped event has a function in
both groups of which it is a member. We can most simply express this in
the theory by stipulating that the time-span segmentation and reduc-
tion are based on underlying group structure rather than the musical
surface. In this way the overlapped event will correspond to two events in
time-span reduction, one in the left group and one in the right.

Section 6.1 also argued that time-span segmentation is determined by
metrical structure at small levels and by the interaction of metrical and
grouping structure at intermediate levels. It was shown there that when
meter and grouping are out of phase, metrically determined time-spans
cross over grouping boundaries. Such crossing would violate the require-
ment for the time-span segmentation to form a strict hierarchy in the
sense of section 2.1. We proposed to solve this problem by appealing to
the distinction between afterbeats and upbeats. An afterbeat forms a
rhythmic unit with the preceding strong beat. An upbeat (a weak beat
such that a grouping boundary intervenes between it and the preceding
strong beat) forms a rhythmic unit with the following strong beat.

We formalize these considerations as follows.

Segmentation Rule 2 In underlying grouping structure,

a. each beat B of the smallest metrical level determines a time-span T;
extending from B up to but not including the next beat of the smallest
level,

b. each beat B of metrical level L; determines a regular time-span T,
which is the union (or sum) of the time-spans of all beats of level L;-,
(the next smaller level) from B up to but not including
(1) the next beat B' of level L; or
(i1) a group boundary, whichever comes sooner, and

c. if a group boundary G intervenes berween B and the preceding beat of
the same level, B determines an augmented time-span Tz, which is the
interval from G to the end of the regular time-span T.

Segmentation Rule 2 produces the time-span segmentation shown in
7.2 for the relevant portion of the finale theme of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony.

In measure 13, the first beat of the half-note level determines two time-
spans, marked u and x. The regular time-span w is assigned by rule 2b;
the augmented time-span x, which includes the upbeat from measure 12,
is assigned by rule 2c.
