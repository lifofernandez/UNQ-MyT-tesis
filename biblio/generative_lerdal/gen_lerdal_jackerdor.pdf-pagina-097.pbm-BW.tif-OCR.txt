Turning to the derivation of the next metrical level, we see in 4.41 the
application of MPRs to the quarter-note level. Only those applications of
the length rule (MPR 5) that span more than a quarter-note's duration
have been marked.

First consider the second half of the passage, which is again richer in
evidence. Since the dominants initiated at 30 and 36 are prolonged into
the following quarter, these beats receive applications of MPR Sf. Simi-
larly, the long notes beginning at 28, 30, and 36 extend into the next
quarter and are marked by MPRs 5a and Se. The change from eighth-note
to quarter-note motion in the bass at 40 is marked by MPR 5d (length of
pattern of articulation).

At beat 46 the situation is more complicated. Within the time-span
46-47, the time-span reduction chooses the V chord as more important,
since it is more consonant than the $ chord on beat 46. The V is then
heard as prolonged into the next quarter, beat 48, since the pitch at 48 is
consistent with that harmony. Hence beat 46 is marked for the inception
of a prolonged harmony as well as for the repetition of the pitch Bp. In
addition, beats 46-48 form a cadence, so MPR 7 applies in this area.

Let us consider the implications of these rule applications for the
choice of the next metrical level. Parallelism throughout the passage
requires that strong beats at the quarter-note level be spaced three apart.
Thus there are three possible placements for the next level of beats in the
portion of the passage examined-so far: 26, 32, 38, and 44; 28, 34, 40,
and 46; and 30, 36, 42, and 48. The first of these is readily eliminated.
There are no applications of MPR 5 on any of these beats, and ap-
plications of MPRs 3 and 6 are weak because they are always adjacent to
another beat where these rules also apply.

The second possibility is more promising. MPR $ applies on beats 28,
40, and 48, and in the latter two of these it is not adjacent to another
application. In addition, the beginning of the long-held treble B at 28
favors this analysis, even more so because it is held so long. The change in
articulation in the bass at 40 and the harmonic change at 46 also rein-
force this analysis. Moreover, this analysis makes the correct predictions
about relative metrical weight within the cadence at 46-48, so MPR 7
(cadence) strongly favors it.

Finally, the third possible analysis is favored by the strong applications
of MPR 5 at 30 and 36. But it makes exactly the wrong prediction about
the cadence at 46-48: the local metrical evidence strongly favors 46 as
the strong beat, whereas this analysis places the strong beat on48. MPR 7
therefore strongly disfavors this analysis. In sum, the metrical evidence
for the second half of the passage favors the dotted-half metrical level
shown in 4.41, though not without some uncertainty at points preceding
the cadence. In particular, there 1s little direct evidence to override the
strongly marked 30 and 36, which are therefore heard as cross-accents.
