they do not, in any direct sense, create a large-scale hierarchy of impor-
tance among these occurrences. In other words, these operations play a
role more like motivic “transformations” than like reductions in or-
ganizing a piece. Thus our hypothetical listener who uses serial principles
to organize his hearing has little counterpart to the elaborational struc-
tures of tonal music, either at local or at global levels.

Granted that serialism is a vastly different kind of organization for
Mmusic, as observed in Babbitt 1960, one could ask whether a human
being could ever become the hypothetical listener we have posited. Could
a listener, through experience, acquire serial principles in such a way as
to be able to comprehend the serial structure of novel pieces in the idiom?
We find little reason to believe this possible, inasmuch as no serial com-
poser has this ability beyond a very limited extent. Most serial compos-
ers, in fact, readily acknowledge the discrepancy berween compositional
and perceptual organization; that is, they do not defend the necessity for
our hypothetical serial listener. Ultimately this is not a matter of opinion
or even a purely theoretical question; it is an empirical question, to be
decided on psychological grounds. (See Meyer 1967, Ruwet 1972, and
Dowling 1972 for a preliminary critique of the cognitive relevance of
serial principles.)

But if principles of serialism are not claimed to be cognitively relevant,
this leaves open the question of what principles the listener actually uses
when he hears serial music. We believe that among the most important
principles he falls back on are the musical universals we have proposed;
he fits the musical surface of a serial piece to structures described by these
principles as best he can.

In addition, it is possible that some of the concepts of recent atonal
theory could be developed into a richer theory of how experienced listen-
ers perceive atonal music. Writers such as Forte (1973) and Rahn (1980)
have laid a systematic groundwork for atonal music (including serial
music) roughly comparable to a formal description of the diatonic system
for tonal music. A fundamental concept of such analysis is that of a sez, a
collection of pitches analyzed as (or perceived as) belonging together.
Sets, like the groups of the present theory, include collections of contigu-
ous events, but they differ in that individual pitches rather than pitch
simultaneities are taken as the smallest units. Thus, as an extreme case, a
set may consist of two pitches chosen from one pitch-event plus three
from the next pitch-event, while the other pitches in these pitch-events
belong to different sets altogether.

These approaches to atonal theory do not specify criteria for what
constitutes a set in a given instance, that is, how an experienced listener
segments a musical surface into its constituent sets. In order to flesh out a
theory of atonal musical cognition, one would first have to develop
well-formedness rules for possible segmentations. As suggested above,
pitches could belong together if in some sense they were contiguous.
