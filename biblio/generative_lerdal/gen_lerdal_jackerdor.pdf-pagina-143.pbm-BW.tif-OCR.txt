Readers familiar with Schenkerian theory will have noticed that the pro-
cedures outlined here produce an Ursatz-like structure at the most global
level of analysis. Specifically, the b for an entire piece is bound to be the
tonic, and the c is bound to be a full cadence; together these create a
1-V—I progression. In many cases, moreover, the 3-2 -1 quasi-Urlinie
(“fundamental line,” the melodic aspect of the Ursatz—a stepwise dia-
tonic descent to the tonic note from another member of the tonic triad)
also resules.

What is one to make of this correlation? From our perspective, the
Ursatz constitutes the most stable “background” structure expressible
within the tonal system, in that it embodies many of the basic harmonic
and melodic principles of tonality (prolongation of the tonic, the circle of
fifths, stepwise linear motion, and so forth). As a consequence, a piece
