1. All the rules developed in chapters 2—9 are listed in the rule index, and the
parts of rules that we conjecture to be idiom-specific are indicated by asterisks.

2. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that one can use other, non-
musical, auditory principles to organize a musical surface. One is presumably
doing this, for instance, when one hears a piece in an unfamiliar idiom as noise
rather than music,

3. That our list covers as much ground as it does is due in part to a reading of
Schachter 1976. This paper suggested to us that our theory could express more
aspects of rhythm than we had realized.

4. The dubious aspects of Reti's (1951) study of thematic transformations are due
to his frequent disregard of hierarchical function.

$. Schoenberg (1911) even uses this “evolutionary” argument to support his
writing of highly dissonant harmonies.

6. Some of this music 1s available on Lyrichord LL189,

7. A related and perhaps more satisfactory hypothesis has been suggested by
writers as different as Mursell (1937) and Partch (1949). They maintain that the
perception of relative intervallic stability is a correlate of frequency rarios: the
simpler the ratio, the easier to comprehend, or the more stable, an interval is.
(Johnston 1964 extends this approach to durational parterns.) Their appeal 1s not
to a direct physical cause such as the overtone series, but to an arithmetical,
mentalistic one. We take no position here on this interesting line of reasoning,
except to observe that cultural convention and musical context are also critical
factors. To the extent that a musical idiom does not utilize simple ratios, conven-
tion and context will play comparably greater roles.

8. Another example: We understand there is now a pocket computer that can
store and play back tunes. Since the tunes are stored numerically, one can take the
square root of a tune and play that back! We doubt, however, that such “trans-
formations” are musically very useful.

1. One must still resist the remptation to try to account for Gestalt principles at
too shallow a level. Hochberg 1974, an admirable reassessment of the Gestalt
tradition, suggests a number of hypotheses, among which are “Organization can
be identified with the structure of the programs of the efferent commands that
would be needed to perform the oculomotor behaviors that are normally appro-
priate to a given stimulus pattern” and “Many of the laws of organization may
simply be good cues as to which way occlusion or interposition occurs.” There is
an obvious difficulty in attriburting the laws of organization to programs in the
visuomotor system: these laws generalize in a quite straightforward manner to
the auditory domain, where there is no corresponding motor activity. We are
somewhat surprised that these generalizations, cited in the earliest research in
Gestalt theory, have been ignored even by specialists. Their existence seems to us
to argue that the laws of organization must be formulated at a level of mental
organization where spatial and temporal information are represented compati-
bly—the level chat Lashley 1951 posits. We know of no general theory of this
level.

2. Katz and Postal (1964) observe that each sentence in 12.1 is ambiguous be-
rween the readings in 12.2, but different meanings are highly preferred. By
calling this difference a stylistic matter, they claim to escape the consequence that
