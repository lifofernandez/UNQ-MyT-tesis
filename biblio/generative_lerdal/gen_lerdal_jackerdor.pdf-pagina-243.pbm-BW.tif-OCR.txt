9.25

 

 

with 9.25, it claims that the two major phrases of the piece do not exhibit
normative structure. Thus there is some reason to prefer analysis 9.24
over 9.25, despite its nonconformance to the basic form. However, as in
the time-span reduction, the piece probably should be ultimately treated
as ambiguous between the two readings, with some additional options in
the treatment of details.

An interesting feature of the Chopin A Major Prelude is that the mel-
ody could have been harmonized throughout with V-I progressions.
However, this possibility would have been unacceptable in the tonal
idiom, because, under either interpretation, 9.24 or 9.25, there would be
no final prepared cadence, and hence no full normative structure. The
way that Chopin toys with this possibility and then deviates from it
contributes to the charm of the piece.

An even more decisive example of normative structure without basic
form is the Brahms Intermezzo op. 76, no. 4. This piece begins on V and
contains no occurrences of T at all until the arrival before the coda (mea-
sure 45). Thus the prolongational beginning cannot possibly be I. More-
over, there is no authentic cadence at the end; rather the bass descends
chromatically to the prolongational ending, which is in turn prolonged
by plagal cadences. Thus the piece is a major deviation from the Ursazz
and the basic form. Nonetheless, it does display the geometry of norma-
tive prolongational structure, as shown in the harmonic sketch (9.26). It
is this structure that permits the piece to be heard as a coherent
(though unusual) example of a standard form, not so different in fact
from the Chorale St. Antoni. In particular, the “cadential” function of
the final bII*S—I progression is inferred from its position in the normative
structure.
