Furthermore, in the context of the whole movement, the theme is the first
of a set of orchestral variations, preceded by an elaborate introduction;
then all the foregoing is paired with an ensuing introduction and varia-
tions, this time with voices; and so forth. All these formal articulations
would be reflected in a grouping analysis of the entire movement. In brief,
at intermediate and large levels the apprehended rhythmic units of a piece
correspond to its grouping analysis. We therefore can assert that any
group is a time-span.

Considering now only the first phrase of the theme, we note that
motivic parallelism divides the phrase into two smaller groups, as shown
in 6.2a. Beneath this level, however, there is little in the music that
permits the assigning of still smaller groupings. At these local levels we
must turn to the metrical analysis in 6.2a for segmentation of the music
into time-spans. Here intuition suggests that there is a rhythmic unit
corresponding to each beat of each level of metrical structure, Example
6.2b represents these rhythmic units in the form of what we call sub-
group bracketing. Each bracket is associated with a particular beat,
commencing at that beat and continuing up to but not including the next
beat at the level in question.

In 6.2b the largest levels of subgroup bracketing, the 2- and 4-bar
levels, are coextensive with the small grouping levels shown in 6.2a. In
such cases, both meter and grouping support the intuition that these are
rhythmic units. But what happens if the subgroup bracketing conflicts
with the grouping, as in measures 12-13 and 20â€”21 of the theme?
Example 6.3 interprets the span from the fourth beat of measure 12 to
the downbeat of measure 13 in incompatible ways: in the subgroup
bracketing the span belongs to measure 12 (by virtue of the regular
