Chapter 1

Notes

1. This consideration militates against Goodman's (1968) characterization of a
piece as the set of performances in conformance with irs score.

2. We concur with Arnheim's view (1974, p. 5) that “Far from being a mechan-
ical recording of sensory elements, vision [and other sorts of perceprion] proved
to be a truly creative apprehension of reality —imaginative, inventive, shrewd,
and beautiful. ... the qualities thar dignify the thinker and artist distinguisl all
performances of the mind.”

3. The distinction underlying this idealizarion corresponds to one sense of Chom-
sky's (1965) distinction berween competence and performance. However, since
these terms have been used in many senses and have been subject to fruitless
polemics, we prefer to avoid this terminology, and wish our idealization to be
understood strictly in the terms outlined here.

4. One means of testing bey ond the kinds presented in this study is by laborarory
experiment, as in the research reported by Dowling (1972, 1978), Deutsch
(1977), Bamberger (1980), and Bever (1980). On rthe nature of scientific stan-
dards for a theory of mental structures such as ours, see Chomsky 1980.

5. Among music theorists, Narmour (1977) has been a vocal critic of the meth-
odology of generative linguistics in music theory. However, Narmour's extensive
criticism of transformational linguistics does not seem to be based on any great
acquaintance with the field, as the only primary source he cites in his bibliography
is Chomsky 1957; furthermore, his discussion contains many elementary errors.
One reason for this might be that Narmour's main source seems to have been
Robinson 1975, accurately assessed in Green 1977.

6. In particular, we will not be concerned whether or nor our theory can readily
be converted into a computer program—one of the more fashionable criteria of
formalization. Though we are not opposed in principle to computational em-
bodiments of formal theories, we will argue thar various aspects of the theory
cannot be so formalized on the basis of present understanding of the issues (see
section 3.3).

7. Sundberg and Lindblom 1976, Kassler 1963, and Smoliar 1974 are examples

of this approach. Babbitr 1972 makes similar assumprions in his discussions of
music cheory based on generatiye linguistics. Winograd 1968 is an interesting
