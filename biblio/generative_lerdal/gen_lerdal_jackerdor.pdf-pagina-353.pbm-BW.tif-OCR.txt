Segmentation Rule 1 (p. 146)
Every group in a piece is a time-span in the time-span segmentation of the
piece.

Segmentation Rule 2 (p. 147)

In underlying grouping structure,

a. each beat B of the smallest metrical level determines a time-span Tr
extending from B up to but not including the next beat of the smallest
level,

b. each beat B of metrical level L; determines a regular time-span Ts,
which is the union (or sum) of the time-spans of all beats of level L;-,
(the next smaller level) from B up to but not including

(1) the next beat B' of level L;* or
(ii) a group boundary,
whichever comes sooner, and

c. if a group boundary G intervenes between B and the preceding beat of
the same level, B determines an augmented time-span Tz, which is the
interval from G to the end of the regular time-span Ts.

TSRWER 1 (p. 158)
For every time-span T there is an event e (or a sequence of events e1e>)
that is the head of T.

TSRWER 2 (p. 158)
If T does not contain any other time-span (that is, if T is at the smallest
level of time-spans), then e is whatever event occurs in T.

TSRWER 3 (p. 159)

I£ T contains other time-spans, let 7;,..., T, be the (regular or augmented)

time-spans immediately contained in T and let e ,...,e n be their respective

heads. Then:

a. (Ordinary Reduction) The head of T may be one of the events e ,...,en.

b. (Fusion) If e1,...,e, are not separated by a group boundary (“locality”
condition), the head of T may be the superimposition of two or more
of € y...,E n

c. (Transformation) If e1,...,e, are not separated by a group boundary,
the head of T may be some mutually consonant combination of pitches
chosen out of €e,...,en.*

d. (Cadential Retention) The head of T may be a cadence whose final is
e, (the head of T,—the last time-span immediately contained 1n 7)
and whose penult, if there is one, is the head of a time-span im-
mediately preceding T,, though not necessarily at the same level.*

TSRWER 4 (p. 159)

If a two-element cadence is directly subordinate to the head e of a time-
span T, the final is directly subordinate to e and the penult is directly
subordinate to the final.
