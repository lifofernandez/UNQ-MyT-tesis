of the opening I; the one in measure 2 is scarcely a chord at all, but a
neighboring motion within a V6; and the one in measure 4, though
important within the phrase, is not as important as the structural accents.

These intuitions all have to do with rhythm—specifically, with
grouping and meter. The V in measure 4 is heard as cadential only
because it articulates the end of a large group; this in itself is enough to
raise it above the [ in measure 4, which by pitch criteria alone is the more
stable of the two. The opening I also occurs at a large grouping bound-
ary, and besides is in a strong metrical position. By contrast, the 1 on the
third eighth of measure 1 and the I in measure 2 do not stand next to
grouping boundaries, and are in weak metrical positions. The I in mea-
sure 4 occurs on a fairly strong beat, but is in the middle of a group.

The solution, then, lies in the proper integration of criteria of pitch
stability with rhythmic criteria based on the grouping and metrical com-
ponents, Schenkerian reductions rely heavily on a tacit knowledge of
these areas. Indeed, Schenkerian analysis is workable at all only because
the analyst himself supplies (consciously or unconsciously) the requisite
rhythmic intuitions. A formal cognitive theory must make this knowledge
manifest through a set of explicit rules.

A reductional theory based only on pitch criteria is deficient in another
respect: it does not restrict in the slightest way the domains over which
events can attach. The criteria for pitch stability alone are “free
floating” — they can connect up events anywhere, as long as the resultant
trees are well formed and the principles of relative consonance and disso-
nance are observed. For example, there is nothing in principle to prevent
the 1 “chord” in measure 2 of 5.10 from attaching at the level of the
whole phrase, even though intuitively it is an elaboration only within the
context of the first half of measure 2.

Again the metrical and grouping structures fill the need, for they offer a
principled way of segmenting a piece into domains of elaboration at
every level—a hierarchy of time-spans. At the most local levels, the
metrical component marks off the music into beats of equal time-spans;
at larger levels, the grouping component divides the piece into motives,
subphrase groups, phrases, periods, theme groups, and sections. Thus it
becomes possible to convert a combined metrical and grouping analysis
into a time-span segmentation, as diagrammed for the beginning of
K. 331 in5.11, (As in section 2.3, the brackets represent time-spans from
beat to beat.) This time-span segmentation can define the domains over
which reduction takes place.

Conseguently, the grouping and metrical components serve a double
function in constructing reductions: they segment the music into
rhythmic domains, and within these domains they provide rhythmic cri-
teria to supplement pitch criteria in the determination of the structural
importance of events.
