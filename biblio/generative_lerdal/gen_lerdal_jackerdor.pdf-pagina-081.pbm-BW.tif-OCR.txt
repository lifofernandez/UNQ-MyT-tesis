The metrical well-formedness rules for tonal music require strong beats
to be equally spaced. When attacks are not evenly spaced, the only solu-
tion for the preference rules is to choose a structure that minimizes viola-
tions of MPR 3. In 4.15 the points where MPR 3 is overridden are marked
with asterisks. Berween points x and y, the metrical structure assigned is
from the local point of view the less preferred one; it is identical to
structure 7i in 4.14a. But this less preferred structure must be accepted in
order to meet the requirement of metrical regularity. Hence this part of
the passage is heard as syncopated. In general the phenomenon of synco-
pation can be formally characterized as a situation in which the global
demands of metrical well-formedness conflict with and override local
preferences, The more severe and extended in time the conflict is, the
more prominent the syncopation.

Next observe that, when attacks occur on adjacent beats, MPR 3 ap-
plies to both of them, saying that both should be heard as strong beats.
But since the well-formedness rules do not permit two adjacent beats to
be equally strong, one must give way to the other. Example 4.16, in
Which applications of MPR 3 have been marked, illustrates this situation.
The reader is cautioned to hear these examples without accents (local
stresses), except where specifically marked, We will take up the effect of
such accents shortly.

Where there are only two adjacent attacks, as in 4.16a, two equally
stable structures exist: either the first attack is the strong beat, as in
structure ¿, or the second is, as in structure úí, In either case MPR 3 is
violated once in every three beats. (Violations are again marked with
asterisks.) The third possible structure that conforms to the rule of par-
allelism (MPR 1) places the strong beat on the rest, as in structure úí? in
example 4.16a. Here there are two violations of MPR 3 in every three
beats, and so the structure is predicted to be less stable than the other
two, This prediction corresponds to the musical intuition that structures ¿
and %í are about equally plausible, and that structure ¿ii is a less nat-
ural way to hear the surface pattern of 4.16a in the absence of other
information,?

Next consider 4.16b, in which there are three adjacent attacks. A
metrical structure that satisfies the well-formedness rules and the re-
