Section 8.3 presented the notion of a normative (or preferred) overall
prolongational structure for phrases and larger levels of grouping. The
principle was stated as a preference for phrases that contain at least one
significant right-branching progression (a departure, increasing tension)
and a doubly embedded left-branching progression (a prepared cadence,
relaxing the tension). The general structure is shown in 9.19.

This section will state the principle more precisely and show how it
affects the choice of prolongational structure in a number of cases.

Statement of the Rule

To arrive at a better understanding of this principle, we begin by asking
two questions: To what groups does the preference for normative struc-
ture apply? How is the normative configuration associated with the se-
lected groups?

To answer the first question we note that intuitions about “normal”
tension and relaxation are not applicable to small groups such as the first
measure of K. 331. Rather they apply to those groups that we designated
in section 7.4 as cadenced groups: groups that at some level of time-span
reduction are represented as a single event (the structural beginning)
followed by a cadence (the structural ending). Recall that the smaller
levels of cadenced groups correspond to the intuitive notion of phrase,
the larger levels to sections, and the largest level to the entire piece. The
rule of normative structure should apply to all these cadenced groups.

Consider now the second and more difficult question. The intuition we
are trying to express is that from the beginning to the end of a cadenced
group there should be a tensing followed by a relaxation. Of course, by
“beginning” we cannot mean the surface beginning, since, for example,
events on upbeats usually do not feel like the point from which the
tension starts. In fact, in large-scale cadenced groups, such as the exposi-
tion of Beethoven's “Tempest” Sonata (see section 10.2), there may be a
rather lengthy structural anacrusis before the point at which the norma-
tive structure begins. Similarly, by “ending” we cannot mean surface
ending, since, as we saw in the Chorale St. Antoni (section 8.5), the
prolongational tension is defused seven measures before the end. Hence
the rule describing normative structure must refer to some more abstract
notion of beginning and ending events than that given by the musical
surface.
