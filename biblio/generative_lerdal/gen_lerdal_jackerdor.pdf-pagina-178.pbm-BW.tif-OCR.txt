oracfor a larger group. This means that neither condition iii of TSRPR 7
nor the condition of TSRPR 8 is met. There are two consequences: first,
there is no way to retain both elements of the cadence, since only
TSRPR 7 would permit this; second, the choice between the first and last
events is determined only on the basis of harmonic and melodic stability.
In the present case the ending is favored, but this might not be so in every
case. It may be desirable to add a special rule to deal with the highest level
of reduction:

TSRPR 9 In choosing the head of a piece, prefer the structural ending to
the structural beginning.

Behind this rule lies the intuition that tonal pieces are fundamentally
goal-oriented.

We next examine a passage where the large-scale reduction is not
symmetrical: the introduction of Beethoven's First Symphony (7.27). It
has often been noted that, although the symphony is in C, its first mea-
sure appears superficially to be a cadence in F. The time-span reduction
will show how, as a consequence of this unusual beginning, the entire
passage functions as a sequence of structural anacruses to the beginning
of the allegro in measure 13.

Before discussing the reduction in 7.28, we must make two comments
on the grouping, First, the largest subdivision of the passage sets off the
first 37 measures from the rest, as a sort of preintroduction consisting
only of wind chords supported by pizzicato; in the rest of the introduc-
tion the melodic line is dominated by the violins. Second, the grouping
contains three overlaps. As argued in section 7.1, time-span reduction is
based on the underlying grouping structure, so that an overlapped event
can be assigned different functions in the two groups to which it belongs.
The overlapped event corresponds to two events in time-span reduction,
one in the left group and one in the right. This dual function appears in
7.28 in measures 8 and 13 (the overlap in measure 10 has already been
reduced out).

Example 7.28 is the reduction of 7.27 from approximately the measure
level to the level of the whole passage. Measures 7 and 10 still contain
more than one event in level e because they are broken by group bound-
aries. We have placed a double bar after the “preintroduction” as a visual
aid.

With the exception of measure 1, to which we will return shortly, the
reduction from the musical surface to level e is relatively straightforward
and requires no comment. The reduction of group 5—13 proceeds down
to level c according to principles familiar from previous examples, lead-
ing to an approximately symmetrical tree in which beginnings and
endings of cadenced groups are of greatest importance. In reducing this
group to level b the final cadence is most important, since it is the c for
the entire introduction.
