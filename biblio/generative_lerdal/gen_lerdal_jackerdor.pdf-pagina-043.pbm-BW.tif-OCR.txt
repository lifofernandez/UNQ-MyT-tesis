These five well-formedness rules define a class of grouping structures
that can be associated with a sequence of pitch-events, but which are not
specified in any direct way by the physical signal (as pitches and dura-
tions are). Thus, to the extent that grouping structures truly correspond
to a listener's intuitions, they represent part of what the listener brings to
the perception of music. This will become clearer as we discuss the pref-
erence rules in the next two sections.

Although the GWFRs rule out as ill-formed certain possible groupings
such as 3.2 and 3.3, they do not preclude the assignment of grouping
structures such as those in 3.5 to the opening of the Mozart G Minor
Symphony.

3.5

 

Though these groupings conform to GWERs 1--5, they do not, we trust,
correspond to anyone's intuition of the actual grouping of this passage.
One might conceivably attempt to deal with this problem by refining the
well-formedness and transformational rules, but in practice we have
found such an approach counterproductive. A different type of rule turns
out to be more appropriate. We will call this type of rule a preference
rule, for reasons that will soon be obvious.

To begin to motivate this second rule type, we observe that nothing in
the GWFRs stated in the previous section refers to the actual content of
the music; these rules describe only formal, not substantive, conditions
on grouping configurations. To distinguish 3.1 from 3.5 it is necessary to
appeal to conditions that refer to the music under analysis. In working
out these conditions we find that a number of different factors within the
music affect perceived grouping, and that these factors may either rein-
force each other or conflict. When they reinforce each other, strong
