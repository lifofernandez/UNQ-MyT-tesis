MPR $ (Length) (p. 84)

Prefer a metrical structure in which a relatively strong beat occurs at the

inception of either

a. a relatively long pitch-event,

b. a relatively long duration of a dynamic,

c. a relatively long slur,

d. a relatively long pattern of articulation,

e. a relatively long duration of a pitch in the relevant levels of the time-
span reduction, or

£. a relatively long duration of a harmony in the relevant levels of the
time-span reduction (harmonic rhythm).

MPR 6 (Bass) (p. 88)
Prefer a metrically stable bass.

MPER 7 (Cadence) (p. 88)

Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which cadences are metrically
stable; that is, strongly avoid violations of local preference rules within
cadences.

MPR $ (Suspension)* (p. 89)
Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which a suspension is on a stronger
beat than its resolution.

MEPR 9 (Time-Span Interaction) (p. 90)
Prefer a metrical analysis that minimizes conflict in the time-span
reduction.

MPR 10 (Binary Regularity) (p. 101)
Prefer metrical structures in which at each level every other beatiis strong.

Metrical Deletion (p. 104)
Given a well-formed metrical structure M in which
i. B,, B., and B3 are adjacent beats of M at level L;, and Byis also a beat
at level L;,1,
li. T¡ is the time-span from B, to B¿ and T; is the time-span from Bz to
Bs, and
tit. M is associated with an underlying grouping structure G in such a
way that both T, and T, are related to a surface time-span T' by the
grouping transformation performed on G of
(a) left elision or
(b) overlap,
then a well-formed metrical structure M' can be formed from M and
associated with the surface grouping structure by
(a) deleting B¡ and all beats at all levels berween B, and Bs and associat-
ing B, with the onset of T', or
(b) deleting B, and all beats at all levels berween B, and Bs and associat-
ing B, with the onset of T”.
