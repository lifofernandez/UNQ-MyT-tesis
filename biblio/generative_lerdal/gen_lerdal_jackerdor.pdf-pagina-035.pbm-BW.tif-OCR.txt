of tonal motion over the duration of the group. The points of structural
accent occur precisely at the attack points of the structural beginning and
cadence; if the cadence has two members (as in a full cadence), the
terminating structural accent takes place at the moment of resolution, the
attack point of the second member of the cadence. Thus, even without a
postcadential extension, there is a short time-span——the duration of the
(second) cadential event— between the terminating structural accent and
the end of the group. These remarks are summarized in figure 2.18, with
b signifying “structural beginning” and c signifying “cadence.”

The relation of structural accent to meter requires lengthier discussion,
because recently there have been several attempts to equate structural
accents with strong metrical accents. We will argue against such a view
and hold instead that the two are interactive accentual principles that
sometimes coincide and sometimes do not.

Before proceeding to the details, let us observe in passing that the
proposed equation of structural and metrical accents would mean giving
up the traditional distinction berween cadences that resolve at weak met-
rical points and cadences that resolve at strong metrical points. Thus
there would be no distinction between “feminine” and “masculine” ca-
dences, or between metrically unaccented large-scale arrivals and large-
scale structural downbeats. In our view this would be an unacceptable
impoverishment of rhythmic intuition.

Taking a closer view, we can schematize the issue as follows. Figure
2.19 represents a normal 4-bar phrase (it could just as well be an 8-bar
phrase), with the b (most likely a tonic chord in root position) at the left
group boundary on the downbeat of the first bar and the c (either a half
or a full cadence) on the downbeat of the fourth bar. For present pur-
poses only two levels of metrical structure need to be indicated: the
measure level and the 2-measure level. Typically, the downbeats of suc-
cessive measures are in a regular alternation of strong and weak metrical
accent. Thus either the downbeats of measures 1 and 3 or the downbeats
of measures 2 and 4 are relatively strong. But since the structural accents
occur on the downbeats of measures 1 and4, there is a conflict: either the
c occurs at a relatively weak metrical point, as in hypothesis A, or the b
occurs at a relatively weak metrical point, as in hypothesis B. The only
way out of this apparent conundrum is to place strong beats both on bs
