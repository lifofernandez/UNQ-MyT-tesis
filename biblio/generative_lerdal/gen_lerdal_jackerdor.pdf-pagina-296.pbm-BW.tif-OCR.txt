11.3

This prediction is not correct. Except in the idiom of bugle calls, some-
thing like 11.4 is more likely, according to the survey of folk-music
idioms by Nettl (1973); this 1s also the pitch collection of the widespread
children's “teasing chant.”

11.4

Example 11.4 might be described as the fifth, sixth, and seventh par-
tials of the hypothetical fundamental C. But such an explanation weak-
ens the principle upon which the pentatonic scale is supposedly based,
namely using the lowest overtones first. Thus the hypothesis of the pri-
macy of the overtone series is not only somewhat incorrect in its predic-
tion about the simplest pentatonic scale, but also seriously questionable
with respect to tritonic scales.

Moreover, the overtone series provides no direct account of versions of
the pentatonic scale containing minor seconds, such as these two cited by
Bernstein:

 

Because the minor second appears in the overtone series only as the
interval between the fourteenth and fifteenth overtones, one well might
ask what happened to all the intervening intervals that are supposedly
easier to hear.

To make things still worse, there are musical idioms in which the
overtone series seems to play no significant role at all. Rouget and
Schwarz 1970 describes a Sudanese idiom whose scale divides the octave
into seven equal intervals, each slightly smaller than a whole step; thus no
intervals other than the unison and the octave are present from the over-
tone series. The two-part music of the island of Krk in Yugoslavia“ in-
cludes, besides the unison and the octave, only multiples of some interval
smaller than the half-step, intervals completely foreign to Western ears.
Yet both of these idioms unmistakably have a tonal center.

Thus, beyond the octave, the fifth, and perhaps the major third, it 1s
difficult to make any useful connection berween the overtone series and
the universality of tonality. In a sense, this result is more significant than
