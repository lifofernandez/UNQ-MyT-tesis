same as before, since their function is local. The result is that the branch-
ings of the 1, the vii”, and the I* in the consequent diverge from the closing
1i16-V—I of that phrase, and connect instead across the phrase boundary,
creating a huge jump in the tree between the IS and the ii“.

Such jumps in prolongational trees have a special meaning: they point
to moments in the musical low where the “structural action” begins to
take place (in this case, with the preparation for the final cadence). More
generally, a right-branching pattern followed by a left-branching pattern
will always create a jump. Such jumps represent major reversals in ten-
sion and relaxation, from ongoing progression toward closure.

These features could never appear within a phrase in time-span reduc-
tion, bound as it is to the time-span segmentation. Indeed, the tree for the
consequent in 8.25c is highly noncongruent, since the time-span tree for
this phrase would make its structural beginning subordinate to the final
cadence, not to the initial I of the antecedent. Together the two kinds of
reduction illuminate the double function of the beginning of any reprise:
on one hand, such a moment begins a coherent musical unit (as conveyed
by time-span reduction); on the other, it repeats and prolongs an earlier
moment (as conveyed by prolongational reduction).

It may be objected nonetheless that the patterns of tension and relaxa-
tion for the consequent phrase in 8.25 are most easily revealed by a local
analysis, and that therefore 8.25a is preferable to 8.25c. We respond that
both analyses are correct, depending on the perspective. A fundamental
feature of musical understanding is that it functions simultaneously in
varying degrees of fragmentation and integration. One can easily imagine
an undeveloped or inattentive listener who hears only partial prolonga-
tional hierarchies, either unconnected or insufficiently integrated with
each other. The experienced listener, on the other hand, follows the
Reduction Hypothesis and integrates all the parts into a whole, while at
the same time hearing the aspect of wholeness within each part. This
truly complex state of affairs could be represented in our theory by
providing multiple preferred analyses signifying different degrees of inte-
gration (for example, both 8.25a and 8.25c). Our more modest goal here,
however, will be to continue to adhere to the simplifying idealizations set
forth in section 1.1, and to develop analyses of only the most global
hearings.

Normative Prolongational Structure

Implicit in the discussion so far is that certain tree patterns recur con-
stantly, whereas others virtually never happen. For example, it is most
unlikely that a phrase or piece begins in utmost tension and proceeds
more or less uniformly toward relaxation (8.26a), or that it begins in
relaxation and proceeds toward a conclusion of utmost tension (8.26b),
or that it begins and ends in tension with a relaxed midpoint (8.26c).
These are suggestive possibilities uncharacteristic of Western tonality.
