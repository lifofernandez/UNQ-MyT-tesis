The reduction of the preintroduction, however, follows different lines.
First, return to the reduction of measure 1. Though measure 1 contains
the correct sequence of chords to form a cadence, it is not the c for any
larger group; so, as in measures 1—2 of the Chopin prelude in 7.24, the
cadence cannot be retained as a whole. The head of the measure will form
the b of group 1--2; thus TSRPR 38 applies, creating a preference for the
first chord, a V7IV, as head. But this chord is less stable than the IV
following it, on grounds of both intrinsic consonance (TSRPR 2) and
harmonic connection to the next time-span (TSRPR 6). The combination
of these two factors accounts for the choice of the IV in level e 0f 7.28.

Next consider the reduction of the preintroduction from level e to level
d. The head of group 1—2 will form a b for group 1-4, so TSRPR 8
applies, choosing the IV in measure 1 over the deceptive cadence in
measure 2. In addition, the IV is harmonically more stable than the vi,
reinforcing this choice. In group 3-4 the V is chosen as head, on all
possible grounds.

In reducing from level d to level c, we first note that the head of group
1-4 will function as the b for the entire introduction; hence TSRPR 8
favors the IV chord. Moreover, since the head of this group will not form
the c for a larger group, there is no pressure from TSRPR 7 to retain the V
in a cadential role. On the other hand, the V is in a stronger metrical
position and harmonically closer to the tonic, and it forms a more stable
progression with the V7 following it in measure 5. These three factors
appear to override TSRPR 8. Hence, as in the reduction of measure 1, the
final event rather than the initial event is chosen as head.

Finally, in reducing from level b to level a—finding the head of the
entire introduction—we confront exactly the same situation: the V
chord representing the preintroduction is less stable than the I represent-
ing the cadence of the entire passage. Thus, despite the fact that TSRPR 8
would prefer the V, the T is chosen as head.

In the reduction as a whole, the picture emerges of a series of be-
ginnings that turn out to be not structural beginnings but structural
anacruses: first the initial V7/IV, then its resolution, then the V at the end
of the preintroduction. The “real” beginning of the piece—the event to
which all that precedes is subordinate—is the final I of the introduction,
which overlaps with the first event of the allegro. This characteristic of
the passage is revealed by the predominance of left branching in the tree.

The introduction to Beethoven's Second Symphony presents an inter-
esting contrast to the analysis just developed, in spite of their similar
large-scale grouping structures. Because its first event is a tonic, there is
never a harmonic reason to select anything else as the b, as there is in
7.28. Hence TSRPR 8 consistently is reinforced by harmonic factors and
can select the initial [ as the b of all the cadenced groups it belongs to. As
a result, this introduction lacks the embedded structural anacruses found
in the First Symphony.
