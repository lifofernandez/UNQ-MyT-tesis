If all large-scale harmonic arrivals were metrically strong, there would
be nothing special about structural downbeats. Yet it is undeniably
significant to the rhythmic flow of a piece whether its cadences articulate
phrases or sections on weak beats before the next phrases or sections
begin (as in a Schubert waltz or a Chopin mazurka), or whether its
cadences arrive on strong beats in an overlapping fashion with ensuing
phrases or sections (as in the Beethoven examples cited above). The
former case produces formal “rhyme” and balance; the latter is dy-
namically charged. The difference is theoretically expressible only if met-
rical and structural accents are seen as independent but interacting
phenomena.

Measures 5-17 of the first movement of Beethoven's “Hammer-
klavier” Sonata (2.23) illustrate both possibilities nicely. The antecedent
phrase (measures 5—8) cadences in a metrically weak position (marked p
in 2.23), but the conseguent phrase is extended in a metrically periodic
fashion so that its cadence (marked q) arrives on a strong hypermetrica!
beat and overlaps with the succeeding phrase. In other words, the local
anacrusis immediately after p begins a structural anacrusis that tenses
and resolves on a structural downbeat at q.

These various discriminations would not be possible if structural and
metrical accents were equated. Perhaps attempts have been made to
equate them because the profound distinction berween grouping and
meter has not been appreciated. In any case, structural accents articulate
grouping structure, not metrical structure. Groups and their structural
accents stand with respect to meter in a counterpoint of structures that
underlies much of the rhythmic richness of tonal music.!
