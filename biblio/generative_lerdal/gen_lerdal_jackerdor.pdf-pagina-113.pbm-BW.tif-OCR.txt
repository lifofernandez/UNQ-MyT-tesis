and beat 1 of measure 2. Likewise (to take a more extreme case), perhaps
the most striking moment in the first movement of Beethoven's Eroica
Symphony is the dissonant climax in measures 276-279 (example 5.5).

But in terms of structural importance, this event resolves into (i.e., is less
stable than, and hence structurally less important than) the dominant of
E minor in measures 280-283, which in turn is subordinate to the
E minor chord at the beginning of measure 284. And, through a process
we will not trace here, the ensuing E minor episode is relatively subordi-
nate within the set of relationships emanating from the fact that the piece
1s in Eb major. Thus the chord in measures 276-279, despite its conspic-
uousness, would be deeply subordinate within a reduction of the whole
movement. The tension of this moment is due in part to the disparity
berween its surface salience and its reductional status.

We do not deprecate the aural or analytic importance of salient events;
it is Just that reductions are designed to capture other, grammatically
more basic aspects of musical intuition. A salient event may or may not
be reductionally important, It is within the context of the reductional
hierarchy that salient events are integrated into one's hearing of a piece.

Some readers may balk at extending the notion of reduction to “back-
ground” levels—so that, for example, an Eb major triad is ultimately all
thatis left of the first movement of the Eroica. Such an extension, it may
be felt, is mechanical, abstract, and irrelevant to perception. There are
two responses to this view. First, exactly where should a reduction stop?
There is no natural place, for there is no point in the musical hierarchy
where the principles of organization change in a fundamental way. Clas-
sical theorists were aware of this when they derived sonata form from the
structure of the phrase. Rosen 1972 (pp. 83-88) illustrates the point
beautifully by showing how Haydn, in his G Minor Piano Trio, actually
develops a miniature sonata form out of a period form. If a phrase can be
reduced, so can the Eroica.

Second, how would our reader feel if an E minor chord, derived from
measures 284 ff. (see example 5.5), stood at the end of a reduction of the
Eroica? Surely he would feel that the piece had been misrepresented. That
solitary, reduced-out Eb major triad means something after all: it is a way
of saying what key the piece is in—and, indeed, that it has a tonic at all.
To be sure, at this level it is scarcely differentiated from Schumann's
Rbenish Symphony, which is also in Ep. Butif a listener hears a piece as
beginning and ending in the same key, he knows (however tacitly) a great
deal about its global structure. There is nothing abstract or perceptually
irrelevant about this. Nor does it deny the many important things that
distinguish one piece from another; these emerge at more detailed levels
of analysis.

Granted human frailty and inattention, it is rare for a listener on a
particular occasion to hear a reduction in its entirety from the smallest
