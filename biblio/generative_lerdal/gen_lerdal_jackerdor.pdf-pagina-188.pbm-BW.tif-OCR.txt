requirement was not a problem for time-span reduction, where the time-
span segmentation always forced a decision one way or the other. The
fluidity of analytic domains in prolongational reduction makes it an issue
here.

Consider equivalence first. In Schenkerian analysis one might wish to
say that two identical events forming a prolongation are somehow the
same event at a more background level of analysis. In the tree notation
the two events would connect as a strong prolongation, but neither event
would dominate the other by right or left branching.3 Thus there would
be no progression toward tension or relaxation, but stasis. The intuitive
justification for such a construction might be that at a certain level of
abstraction one hears a hierarchy not of discrete events but of harmonic
areas.

However, this approach is inadequate. It goes against the grain of the
theory as a whole, in which each event is taken in principle as “real” at all
relevant levels of analysis. One may hear harmonic areas (these are in any
case enclosed within a prolongation), but one also hears all the dis-
tinctions among individual events, even those that are strongly pro-
longed. It is impossible to hear absolute stasis, ¡f only because events take
place in time and hence form rhythmic relationships that produce tensing
or relaxing effects.

Let us be more specific. At local levels, one has elementary intuitions
about “prolongational anticipation” and “prolongational repetition.”
For example, in 8.8a the first I chord is heard as an anticipation of the
second 1, but in 8.8b the second I is heard as a repetition of the first. In
terms of tension and relaxation, the anticipation (8.8a) relaxes into the
following downbeat, whereas the repetition (8.8b) tenses in response to
its surrounding stronger beats. Therefore, as the trees in 8.8 indicate,
prolongational anticipation receives a left branch, prolongational repeti-
tion a right branch.

At global levels, on the other hand, the concept of prolongational
anticipation makes no sense. For example, the opening tonic in a
sonata-form movement is never heard as an anticipation of its restate-
ment at the beginning of the recapitulation; rather, the beginning of the
recapitulation is heard as a prolongational repetition of the opening. The
