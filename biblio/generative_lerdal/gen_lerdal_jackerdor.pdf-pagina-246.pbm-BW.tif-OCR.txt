of the dominant. Here a prolongation to the dominant of the final ca-
dence would be impossible; the relative major is heard as a departure
from the initial tonic. One does not hear any great structural difference
between the two alternatives, and in fact in the cello suites in minor keys
Bach sometimes chooses the dominant minor and sometimes the relative
major. Thus, for generality, 9.28a cannot be the correct structure for this
piece.

The PRPRs create a different tree. Within the basic form, derived from
level b of the time-span reduction, the most stable prolongational con-
nection possible in the next two time-span levels is that between the IV
chord in level d and the V of the final cadence; a weak left prolongation
to the V in measure 8 or 9 would be considerably weaker. The Interac-
tion Principle thus selects the IV as the next event added to the basic
form, as shown in 9.28b.

Between the initial I and the IV, the dominants surrounding the double
bar are most time-span-important. They do not form a strong prolonga-
tional connection to the following TV, but can be attached as a departure
from the initial I. What is the correct way to do this? Two possibilities
appear in 9.28c,d: in 9.28c the end of the first section is superordinate
and the beginning of the second section is its elaboration; in 9.28d the
reverse is the case.

Intuitively, 9.28c appears to be the correct choice. The end of the first
section is a definite point of harmonic arrival, more important to the
piece's progress than the beginning of the second section. This is clearer if
we compare with structurally parallel pieces such as the sarabande of the
C Minor Cello Suite. Here the first section ends on III, and the second
section begins immediately with III?, already a departure from the point
of stability. Again under the assumption that at large levels of structure
many examples of this genre are structurally parallel, this comparison
leads us to conclude that 9.28c is the correct structure for 9.27.

The preference rules favor this result. If the V in measure 9 is chosen
first, as in 9.28d, the V in measure 8 must be attached as a relatively
