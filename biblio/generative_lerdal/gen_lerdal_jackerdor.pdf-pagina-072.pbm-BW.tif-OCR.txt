Metrical Structure

This chapter is concerned with the information the listener uses to asso-
ciate a metrical structure with a musical surface. As in the grouping
component, the principles governing this association are divided into
well-formedness rules and preference rules. The former define the set of
possible metrical structures, and the latter model the criteria by which the
listener chooses the most stable metrical structure for a given musical
surface. We begin with well-formedness rules, then turn to preference
rules. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 present further discussion of well-formedness
rules.

To review the formalism for metrical structure, recall that each row of
dots below the music symbolizes a level of metrical structure. If a beat at
a given level Liis also a beat at a larger level, we call it a strong beat of L;
ifitis not, it is a weak beat of L. Example 4.1 illustrates the formalism.

At the eighth-note level the beats at 2, 5, 8, and 11 are strong and all
other beats are weak. In turn, at the dotted quarter-note level 2 and 8 are
strong and 5 and 11 are weak. At the dotted half-note level 2 and 8 are
beats; however, since no larger level of beats is present in this structure,
the distinction strong-weak at this level is undefined. It is the interaction
of different levels of beats (or the regular alteration of strong and weak
beats at a given level) that produces the sensation of meter.
