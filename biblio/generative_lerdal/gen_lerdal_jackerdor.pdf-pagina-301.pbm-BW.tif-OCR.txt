hierarchy of grouping structure. At bottom, all of these trends are mani-
festations of a tendency to avoid repetition.

We do not wish to address the cultural or aesthetic reasons for this
tendency, nor do we want to make value judgments. But it is in the spirit
of our inquiry to ask what the cognitive consequences of these kinds of
organization are for the listener, assuming he is using the principles of
musical cognition we have proposed.

As pointed out in section 11.1, the absence of some kind of organiza-
tion in the musical signal eliminates the influence of the relevant prefer-
ence rules. Consider first the absence of a tonal center. In this case, none
of the preference rules that refer to pitch stability will be applicable to the
musical surface. As a result, the choice of important events in the time-
span reduction will be constructed almost exclusively on rhythmic
grounds. Pitch enters only through consideration of linear connections
(TSRPR 6) and registral extremes (TSRPR 3). The absence of cadential
formulas of some kind removes an important indicator of larger-scale
time-span reductional structure.

In the prolongational reduction, linear relationships are greatly weak-
ened, with the partial exception of melodic or harmonic identities (strong
prolongations). Thus the connection with time-span reduction (PRPRs 1
and 2), itself determined mostly on rhythmic grounds, remains as the
chief determinant of prolongational structure. In other words, the theory
predicts that intuitions of tension and relaxation, which the prolonga-
tional reduction is designed to express, are based less on pitch factors
than on rhythmic, dynamic, and timbral considerations, and that large-
scale pitch connections do not play a great role in the listener's com-
prehension of the music.

Suppose in addition that, as often happens, there is little evidence for a
regular metrical structure. Then, as discussed in section 4.4, the metrical
well-formedness rules fail to impose any extrinsic organization on the
pattern of phenomenal accents in the musical surface. The resulting met-
rical structure follows the irregularities of local detail and hence cannot
be extended to any depth. (Recall from chapter 4 how the presumption of
regularity was fundamental to the construction of a metrical hierarchy,
especially for the larger levels of complicated examples.) An immediate
consequence is that metrical tensions such as syncopation become hard to
project. Furthermore, the mutual interaction of meter and time-span re-
duction is weakened: not only are there fewer metrical distinctions avail-
able to affect choice of time-span heads (through TSRPR 1), but, because
of the absence of pitch stability, there are fewer time-span distinctions
available to affect metrical choices (through MPR 9). Insofar as the time-
span reduction 1s weakened by metrical irregularity, the prolongational
reduction is weakened too.

All these factors contribute to the weakening of grouping organization.
Since the music in question usually avoids symmetry and overt repetition,
