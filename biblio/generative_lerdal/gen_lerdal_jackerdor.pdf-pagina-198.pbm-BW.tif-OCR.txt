of the phrase. That leaves branching % as the obvious choice. A moment's
reflection reveals that this is only logical, since all the branchings in 8.21a
are left branches, signifying relaxations at various levels. Clearly there
must first be tension f relaxation is to follow; therefore there must be at
least one right branch off the opening 1, indicating a departure, before the
left-branching cadential nucleus.

There are, of course, numerous right-branching possibilities —for in-
stance the ascending circle of fifths in 8.22.

8.22

 

This example in effect combines 8.18a and 8.18b into one. In such a
symmetrical case there occurs a point of reversal where the branching
could conceivably go either way (hence the dashed branches in 8.22); in
practice, the issue can usually be decided on rhythmic grounds or on the
basis of structural parallelism.*

Far more common than ascending-descending sequential patterns is
the right (strong or weak) prolongation of the opening tonic, within
which further elaborations proliferate; the tonic prolongation (7 in
8.21b) is then followed by the cadential nucleus, as shown in 8.23a. Thus
the phrase divides prolongationally into more or less unequal halves.
Examples 8.23b—8.23e provide four elaborated illustrations of 8.23a,
each freely based on a model from the classical literature (8.23b from
Schubert's song “Morgengruss,” 8.23c from “O Haupt,” 8.23d from the
K. 331 theme, and 8.23e from the opening of Beethoven's Sonata
op. 109).

Some comments on 8.23c—8.23e are in order. According to the
branching criteria sketched above, the second event in 8.23c (the IV)
should attach not to the ensuing IS but to the preceding I. We have
attached it to the IS because of mutually supporting linear criteria in the
bass and the soprano. This is a good example of how vertical and hori-
zontal factors can conflict. In 8.23d the point of interest lies in the double
neighboring motion of the V$ to the I and the “vi7” to the VS. The
neighboring motion is represented in the tree by a right-branching pro-
gression enclosed within a right-branching strong prolongation; this
