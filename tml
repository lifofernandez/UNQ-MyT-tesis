    \begin{equation}1=0\end{equation} will number the equation as 1,2,... –

    What does one example look like (LaTeX source is better than a picture
    here). – John Kormylo May 5 '17 at 22:43

    Welcome to TeX SX! Do the examples have to be each on a line of its own? –

    Could you please edit your question title to something that gives people a
    sense of what your question is about. Also perhaps a place to start is What
    are good learning resources for a LaTeX beginner. Also, for math
    formatting, the mathmode documentation is very useful. – Alan Munn May 5

  • define new counter
  • define new environment with title and number
  • increment counter before its use

Something like this:

\newcounter{xmpl}
\newenvironment{example}
    {\noindent
     \refstepcouter{xmpl}
     \textbf{Example \thexmpl }
    }{\par\noindent%
      \ignorespacesafterend}

and then use as:

\begin{example}
< content of the example>
\end{example}

Addendum: More simpler and straightforward solution is consider Christian
Hupfer comment below: use of newtheorem.

  • load package amsthm
  • declare example environments as \newtheorem{example}{Example}
  • use it as shown above

More details and concise description about theorems like environments you can
find in Wikibook LaTeX/Theorems. Sorry, because I didn't recall for this usual
approach before.

Addedndum 2: You can also use enumerate environment. Package enumitem offer
simple redefinition of labels:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{lipsum}

\begin{document}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=Exercise \arabic*]
\item \lipsum*[11]
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]
\item blah blah
\[
a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}
\]
\item blah blah
    \end{enumerate}
\end{document}

For other possibilities for formatting of enumerate environment see package
documentation.

Of course this recent solution has sense if examples are organised as list,
i.e. examples follow one after another.

    You could also mention the usual \newtheorem approach, \newtheorem{example}
    {Example}, for example (pun intented ;-)) – user31729 May 6 '17 at 6:49

    @ChristianHupfer, thank you very much for comment. I consider it in my
    answer. – Zarko May 6 '17 at 8:07
